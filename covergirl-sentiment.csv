Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Didn’t get to try because......,"January 24, 2020",560 Medium,1,There were little hard pieces of something all throughout this. Not sure if I got a bad tube or what.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Healthy Coverage,"December 6, 2019",520 Fair,4,"It’s a decent size tube that is a healthier option without parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. The top twist-opens and it squirts out with applied pressure from the tube. It is lightweight and covers very well!! It’s not drying. Good moisturizing liquid foundation. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t break my face out. I like that it has coconut and aloe, which is healing to skin. It did blur out my skin issues. My “before/after” photo shows a great reduction in redness. It was hard to blend out. I did apply this Fair 530 foundation with spot application method (after a thin layer over entire face/neck, I went back and applied a spot touch to the red spot by my jawline and allow to set for a minute before softly blending out). That means it is applied thicker, with layers, to my skin flaws. I could still see where the flaw was located, but it removed the redness so much that people would have to be very close to notice the skin issue. Covers well and stayed on during the workday."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,You NEED this in your life!,"March 17, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,5,"I love this so so much! It's perfect for everyday makeup. I'm so glad I bought it, I don't have that issue with the ""granules"" on the foundation, it just smells kinda strange to me but nothing too crazy.It has more coverage than what I expected... you really need to work it into the skin with a brush first and then going with a beauty sponge because with a brush itself it'll leave marks.The shade Medium Tan looks slightly dark in the picture but is a perfect match for me.💕"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Big fan!,"January 5, 2020",550 Light/Medium,5,"This is essentially a tinted moisturizer. That being said, that’s exactly what I wanted and I really, really like this formula. This evens out my skin tone well, and makes my skin look dewy and fresh. The color is perfect and blends well. It goes on well with fingers or with a large foundation brush, and stays well. The only gripe I have with this is an underlying scent—it’s not terrible, and it fades, but it smells...strange. I can totally get over the smell because the product is what I was looking for, but may be a sticking point for others."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight good coverage,"May 18, 2020",560 Medium,3,"Love this foundation, i am a makeup artist and i don't like wearing heavy makeup in the summer. This foundation is very lightweight and moisturizing for my dry skin. The only complaint i have is that there are little weird pieces in the foundation i imagine is a natural build up of the product due to no formaldehyde or another ingredient to keep it from clumping. These pieces are harmless just can be annoying to pick out. I am wearing shade 560 in medium its perfect."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,VERY Impressed.,"February 29, 2020",530 Fair/Light,5,"I'm all things CG since they went Leaping Bunny Certified. I was hesitant to try this ONLY because it's light coverage and I have always worn at least medium. I actually dont mind that aspect at all. It's buildable if I wanted to apply a bit more to cover redness in the cheek area. So many good things about this foundation. It actually is long lasting and I don't use primer and have also went to the gym in it after work. Stayed on yet cleaned off nicely in the evening. Next--no transfer! I am surprised how well this stays put and just feels good on.I have always worn the ""X10"" series in color options. Classic Ivory in every covergirl foundation. This however, required that I use 530. I am fair and assumed 520 would do it, but it was too pale for my tone. I also appreciate how there was no oxidation--that orange hue that may occur. Probably because of the toxins removal or the lack of spf that may make my skin react?!?I live in a dry climate so the dewy affect took some time as the day went on, but it never appeared greasy or shiny on me. Overall, this is now my favorite and I hope it is never discontinued!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Love it!,"February 6, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,"I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to makeup, and I usually tend to wear very little because of this. This foundation is very light and doesn't feel cakey at all. My skin doesn't dry after using it, like it does with other foundations. It blends very easily and helps hide some spots that bug me. I highly recommend it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Watery but its great,"February 15, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,4,"I live and Florida and its always hot and stayed on all day but when I first put it on it felt so watery, other than that it was great."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pressed powder shade light; inaccurate ingredients,"June 10, 2021",,4,"Wanted to provide some pictures for an idea of what the shade 'light' looks like. I have a light skin tone but this was a little too tan for me. I think the shade fair would have been better. This would probably work well as a light-application bronzer that you can build up, if you have fair to light skin. Also, an issue I had was with the listed ingredients. The ingredients shown on amazon are not accurate, with the real list being: mica, kaolin, zinc stearate, oat kernel flour, octyldodecyl Stearoyl stearate, tapioca starch, isopropyl palmitate, calcium silicate, dimethicone, water, 1,2-hexanediol, caprylyl glycol, phenoxyethanol, sorbitan sesquioleate, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, iron oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI77499), titanium dioxide (CI 77891) Very affordable, cruelty free, vegan, works as expected, but didn't appreciate the phenoxyethanol as well as not having the full ingredient list shown before buying"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,WORKS WELL ON AGING SKIN TOO!,"April 24, 2021",520 Fair,5,"I like this foundation! I’m in my early 60’s, and need a semi matte foundation that evens my skin tone but doesn’t look like I have heavy makeup on. A foundation that is too dewy looks ridiculous on an older lady, but a foundation that is too heavy just builds up in existing wrinkles/lines, making them appear much worse than they are. This one is pretty good! It’s just a tad heavier than what works best for me, so I add a drop of ELF Hydration Drops to it before applying it to my face and the result is perfect! I get a very natural looking, evened out complexion that looks more like I'm not wearing makeup at all. The foundation is light weight, and goes on smoothly and easily.  The hydration drops would likely not be needed on younger skin at all, and probably not even for all older skin. But for me, adding one drop gives me the coverage and skin texture that is perfect for what I need. I highly recommend this foundation!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Allergic! + too thin/streaky.,"July 18, 2020",520 Fair,1,"PLEASE post the ingredients on the Amazon listing! I'm allergic to Limonene. I guess I should have looked up the ingredients of the product on another site. This made my face itch/burn. I have a citrus allergy and can't use products with Limonene. I have never even seen a foundation with limonene before ... *smh* I've yet to find an affordable ""free from"" foundation. My hopes were high and even though I like a medium weight foundation, I thought I'd try this lightweight to see if I liked it. I have BB and CC cream thicker than this.Disappointing all-round."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Awful,"March 7, 2020",530 Fair/Light,1,"Goes on well but few hours later I notice the skin on my face feels very 'pitted'. I have no acne scars or have had issues with pitted feeling skin before. My face just felt...clumpy. Day 2 I tried a different primer and once again a few hours later my skin feels lumpy/pitted. After washing it off and applying a different foundation the following day, no pitty feeling so I know this foundation had something to do with it. Might work for others but definitely not for me :("
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,GRITTY— gross!!!,"January 2, 2022",520 Fair,1,"I bought this foundation in two shades since it was on sale for less than $5, and I typically fall between the lightest and second lightest shade where foundation is concerned. I got porcelain and fair. Tried porcelain last night and while it does seem nice, it was also a bit light (as expected.) Today I tried fair, and after prepping my skin I started applying with a damp beauty blender sponge. IMMEDIATELY I noticed tons of grittiness, and I thought my sponge was dissolving on my face, but when I looked at it it seemed fine. Rinsed sponge thoroughly with soap and water, washed my face, and then applied the product to the back of my hand and spread it out with my fingers. Yeah, tons of little clumps in the product. I don’t know what they are, but the fair shade is immediately getting returned. I’ll keep porcelain since it seems fine, but I will not be repurchasing this item."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Tinted Moisturizer,"May 6, 2020",600 Rich,3,"This does feel lightweight on the skin,it has a weird smell kinda like peanut butter lol I don’t know but a weird not horrible smell. I did feel a lil tingling on my skin didn’t last long but did notice that upon application. The color is definitely off I’m in NC45 shade in Mac foundations and I got 600 rich and it’s too light, color pay off is more of a tinted moisturizer. I’m almost tempted to get the next shade up but don’t want to waste my money if that shade doesn’t work out. One other thing is this didn’t have a seal on it that you peel off before applying not sure if that’s normal but wanted to mention so you are aware. I think I could/would like this tinted moisturizer if I could find my shade despite the weird smell. Hope this helps!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Absolutley love it of all make up,"November 18, 2021",510 Porcelain,5,"I love how it went on, how lite it feels on my skin and the youtfull appearance it gives my skin, I have procelian,  fair skin, and this fair matches exactly and I bought the next shade darker to contor...I have purchased very exspencive make ups from Ulta Beauty and paid very huge credit card balances, but I found this to give me a more youthful appeance ...I DO get diamond microdermabrasion once a month, and have a skin routine with great products to take care of my skin and I put a lot of money into products, so I was quite surprised I have fallen in love with these products.....quite quite surprised to say the least ..I could have saved myself 100s of dollars..if I had know about these products years ago..All I can say is Thank God I've found them now....and I wish they came in larger sizes....love them."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good Daily Foundation but NOT Dewy OR Moisturizing,"January 6, 2022",540 Light,4,"Overall I liked the product. I got the shade Ivory. It looks very dark in the tube but blended out its perfect. However.........this is VERY runny. DO NOT hold the tube upside down it just leaks out everywhere via gravity. This is touted as a moisturizing formula with a dewy finish. It's NOT. It actually felt somewhat drying on my normal skin. The finish would be like a satin. It was nice actually, but if you actually have dry skin this is NOT for you. It was lightweight and gave a nice light coverage, slightly more than a tinted moisturizer and I could build it up a bit. The wear is better than expected and lasted all day. Its nice for daily wear, and a no makeup look, especially for less than $5.....but it's not as mind blowing as social media has hyped it up to be."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,For the gym,"February 23, 2021",550 Light/Medium,2,"I have a container of products that don’t quite make the cut that I wear specifically to the gym because I paid for them and I’m not wearing them anywhere special… This wouldn’t even be sufficient from a working at home standpoint as it has very little coverage. I think the terminology “skin milk“ is Very suitable for this product. It is watery and at first glance you would want to apply it with your hands, but then moving the product around is difficult so you’ll need a sponge. Under no circumstances is would I use A brush. I did get this product for four dollars I would never dream of spending full price for this product. If I had a 13-year-old daughter I would suggest this as her first introductory face product. I guess that’s why they call it “cover girl” , and not cover woman. Just for reference I typically use Anastasia Beverly Hills as my stable foundation. I think the packaging is cute, it is small as well."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good for price,"November 24, 2020",,4,"This is a good product for the price!Pros- it’s very cheap & looks airbrushed. Also, I have acne prone skin and it doesn’t seem to break me out. I also have dry and sensitive skin and it seems to be good for that.Cons- It has some kind of sparkles in it? Also there is no place in the compact to hold the sponge. The light shade pulls more of an orange tone. Might not be suitable for cooler skin tones."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Runny,"April 7, 2021",530 Fair/Light,4,"I want to preface by saying that I never intended to wear this as a full face foundation. I needed something somewhat moisturizing to ""carve"" my eyebrows. I have to pluck daily and sometimes I have dark roots showing so I use concealer to cover it up.Pros:goes on smoothlyno odorwhen used under eyebrows, works as a highlightervery inexpensiveCons:very runny consistencyif you do not store with the lid up, it will leakwhen I did try to use as a spot cover up here and there, it was too thin to cover anything"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Disappointed in New Product,"April 29, 2020",560 Medium,1,"Coty recommended this product as a ""new"" substitute for the Ready, Set, Gorgeous that was taken off the market that I have been using for years.  This product does not compare.  It not only had a terrible odor, it made my skin dryer for something that has coconut oil in it.  Very disappointed.  I sent a product review to Coty.  They have yet to give me a comparable product to try.  They blew it by getting rid of RSG."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,A pleasant surprise,"November 13, 2021",550 Light/Medium,5,"I bought this cuz some chick on tiktok recommended it and I've been looking for a casual foundation (I.e. not tryna look glam, just tryna to look nice on days when I have to interview job candidates or give presentations to senior leaders). Normally I use hourglass foundation which has great full coverage but it doesn't always sit nice on the fine lines and it feels/looks a bit cakey sometimes. I must say, I don't think I have ever received more compliments on my makeup than when using this foundation. Like others mentioned it's buildable coverage but generally more sheer. That ends up being it's strength though, because it looks really natural and doesn't exaggerate lines or your skin's texture. It brightens and evens out your face. If hiding blemishes is really important to you, then you're probably not going to like this, but I have personally invested in a good skincare ritual so I don't have a ton of those to cover up myself. It feels so light and breathable that I kept forgetting I had makeup on the times I used it. Really happy with this purchase and will continue using it. It's kind to my skin and a lot cheaper than hourglass, so that's a big plus too. For reference: I'm a 30yo woman with somewhat dryer skin, little to no acne, and I love/am experienced with makeup, but I don't wear it every day."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Wonderful.,"November 7, 2021",530 Fair/Light,5,"Love this make-up. Have to tell you though, you'll have to start a whole new way of applying your make-up. Other foundations I have used allow you to take quite a bit on your finger and smooth it all over your forehead or cheek. This foundation is different. Take a small dot on your finger at a time, because it doesn't spread on your face, it's going to soak in right where you put it, very quickly. I had to learn to do a small area at a time. Love the coverage. Not oily looking at all. Looks like I finished it off with loose powder, which I don't have to do anymore. Wonderful."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Hard to find a color,"September 28, 2020",,4,"This powder is actually really good.  But the color in the picture does NOT match the actual product AT ALL!! I chose the color from the picture and my face was completely white!!  The coverage is good, but not sure how I'll actually figure out the right color."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Terrible Shade Range,"February 24, 2021",610 Rich/Deep,2,"I bought this in tan thinking it would match but it was too light, so I just put on a darker setting powder and a lot of bronzer. The good thing is it’s the definition of light coverage. There’s not much building up you can do. The strange thing is it actually lasts on my oily skin. So for me to find something that works that doesn’t look and feel like a mask was great. I liked it so much a few days later I went down TWO shades to rich/deep and it’s still a tad too light! That is definitely not rich/deep. And for some reason my first bottle was fine but the second one did have little gritty pieces in it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Where is 130 Pressed Powder??,"April 19, 2021",,3,"I’m a fan of cover girl creamy natural pressed powder, but I switched to natural make up. When I saw covergirl made a new line without the harmful chemicals, I excitedly ordered!! First I got the 120 fair color, but it was too light and chalky. The next darkest color is 140 light pale, but I just got it and it’s too dark!!! 😭 I’m quite upset I bought it twice and still didn’t find my shade. Please make one in between 120 and 140!!! I will be going back to my Pacifica shade 1 which does match my skin tone."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Don't waste your money,"June 9, 2021",550 Light/Medium,1,"It comes in a ziploc bag, and opened, it does not have the security patch!  Looks like used, definitely not going to use this product on my face"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Used make-up?,"March 17, 2020",530 Fair/Light,2,Bought 2 shades and both bottles/tubes did not have a silver seal on the opening or a seal by the lid/tube. So is that normal or are they sold opened and used??  It does have a slighty weird smell. Had hoped this foundation would br good on my skin that can be a bit dry sometimes but even with primer the foundation crumbled on my skin within seconds.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not great,"February 25, 2020",520 Fair,1,"This product does not blend well.  It sat on top of my skin & settled into my pores.  I tried applying w/ fingers, a sponge & a make up brush in the hopes that it would blend better but, unfortunately, it did not."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Dry clay like feeling,"April 7, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,3,I used Cover Girl as a young lady... loved it for years... switched to “better” brands... when this came out I wanted to try to it (half the cost of my mainstay) the color was fine but it was very dry - like clay on my skin... maybe just me.. but that’s my impression.. won’t buy it again. I guess it really is time to move on.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Just saw some tiny pieces,"January 22, 2021",530 Fair/Light,1,"It's so watery. Won't cover my acne marks. This will only look good if your skin is as smooth as my baby's skin. But, the color fits my skin tone perfectly. There are tiny pieces - like tissue. I'm sorry, but, is this expired or fake? Cause, the liquid is separating from the solid ingredient of the foundation. I don't want to return but what is the sense of keeping this here."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Too tacky on the skin,"September 17, 2021",530 Fair/Light,2,The color and consistency of this product is very good but unfortunately once it was applied it felt very tacky and stick it on my face and it never really dry down so after several hours it’s still so felt the same stickiness. It was too uncomfortable to wear and after two hours I had to wash it off. The color was OK but just didn’t work for me
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"If you like full coverage, this isn’t your type of foundation","February 15, 2020",530 Fair/Light,3,"When applying this it has a shine to it. It felt like I was applying a bb cream with spf. Not foundation like at all, but the thing is, I do like it. I am not much of a makeup wearer, so I don’t mind that it doesn’t look matted or has excellent coverage. The color matches perfect with my skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great lightweight foundation,"February 7, 2020",530 Fair/Light,5,I don’t really like foundation anymore but it’s impossible to find a BB cream in my shade. This stuff is perfect! It’s the perfect shade and has very light natural coverage that doesn’t cling to my dry patches. It sets very nicely with primer and setting powder to not be too dewy that I look oily
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Love the concept, texture is a miss","February 23, 2020",520 Fair,1,"I wanted to love this product, it’s vegan, didn’t break me out, and was pretty light weight. However, as other reviews said it becomes very chalky on the skin and looks like there’s dry clumps of foundation everywhere. I tried using a primer, using powder over it vs no powder, but It just doesn’t look natural at all"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Ugh,"May 2, 2020",540 Light,1,"I was really looking forward to try this but Didn’t even get to because when I swatched it on my hand there were little tiny hard things in it. I thought it was me so I wiped it and tried 2 more times, each time I swatched it, tiny hard particles in it :("
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Irritated my skin,"May 23, 2020",580 Tan,1,"I don't have overly sensitive skin, but I had to wash this off immediately after applying a small amount to my cheek. It made my skin feel like it was burning and after washing it off, my skin was irritated for a couple days."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Dry Skin Approved! Makes Skin Look Blurred and Flawless,"August 1, 2021",,5,My new Holy Grail powder. I have dry skin and it's nearly impossible to find good powders that don't sink into fine lines and make me look crusty. This is a gorgeous powder that provides coverage and literally blurrs the skin like an ig filter. I have a full review on my YouTube channel-JLaurenGlow
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,texture was bad,"February 27, 2020",560 Medium,1,"I ordered both the light and medium shades. When I went to use the medium shade, it felt very gritty on my fingers. I thought maybe it was something on my hand so I washed them and tried some more. Still gritty. One more try and it was the same.  The light shade was perfect so I am not sure what happened with this one."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pretty natural finish,"June 1, 2020",550 Light/Medium,5,"This is a very sheer coverage foundation. It’s more like a tinted moisturizer or a bb cream than actual foundation. It is beautiful on though, it’s a very natural finish. It’s says it’s buildable coverage but it doesn’t look great layered up. It does have an odd smell but that doesn’t bother me because it wears all day and looks like my skin but slightly better."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Total trash,"February 17, 2020",560 Medium,1,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Read these reviews before purchasing. There is something solid in these bottles. I don't know what it is, but there should not be chunks in a cream makeup.It started burning within seconds of going on my face and I couldn't get it cleaned off fast enough."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Hydrating BB cream coverage!,"May 24, 2020",550 Light/Medium,5,"Works for me!I read reviews about the crumbs that ball up when you apply it, I did experience a little bit of this but not enough to bother me. Once I work it in, they dissolve.The scent to me smells a bit chocolatey.. cocoa... not too strong.. smells fine.Feels nice on my skin. Very moisturizing and hydrating. Gives me a nice fresh glow. My favorite!Coverage is just as a BB cream. Sheer with minimal coverage but evens out the skin tone and gives me life. I love that it’s paraben and all-that-other-stuff-free. I will continue using this!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl Foundation,"November 3, 2021",520 Fair,4,"I like this foundation for the most part. It goes on nicely and evenly, and has a sheer tint to it. I'm fairskinned so I don't need anything dark at all. Only negative would be that it's a bit too runny. I'd like for it to be a bit thicker where it didn't feel like water running down my face. Otherwise, good product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great product for light coverage,"March 3, 2021",520 Fair,4,I buy this product all the time. It’s lightweight with just enough coverage. It’s watery NOT full coverage.  I only gave this 4 stars because u like when I purchase it from other stores... the safety sticker was missing on both tubes. These don’t look used* but the safety sticker was missing off the 2 I purchased.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Big surprise,"September 26, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,"I was excited to try out this product, and it did not disappoint. I was worried at first, because the product is very runny. I thought it wouldn't cover. However, it has a very decent coverage. It is sheer, so you need to do 2 layers over any red spots, but it really covers more than a bb cream. Also, it is so light weight. You feel like you aren't wearing anything at all. I love it"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Looks great, feels great, stays great!","November 17, 2021",570 Medium/Tan,5,"I have been LOOKING. For a foundation like this. I'm so glad I found this thanks to TikTok. I don't know what people mean when they say it smells funky, to me it just smells like almond milk which is A+ for me. I have combination skin type and even on my oily parts of my face this foundation never budges. As for the dry parts, it's so moisturizing to where i don't cake like with other foundations. If you've been searching for a foundation forever like me and are on a budget, PLEASE try this one!! I've never seen a more waterproof foundation in my LIFE!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good for some. Not for me.,"July 13, 2020",540 Light,3,"It's good for someone who already has perfect skin and just wants to add a little tint or perhaps even out slight discoloration. But as someone who has some acne pigmentation and lots of redness on and around the nose...this did nothing for me. It made my skin appear a little darker from the tone I picked and it also added moisture. Very nice. But seriously... it's like a watered-down foundation. If you're someone who's looking for ""light coverage"" then you probably don't even need foundation. Just use a concealer."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,LOVE,"October 25, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,I absolutely love this foundation. It’s sheer but build able coverage and stays on better than any of my other foundations.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Contains Oil - Clogged my Pores,"July 22, 2020",520 Fair,1,"I don't understand why makeup companies continue to put oil in cosmetics.  It clogs pores and causes acne.  I was not able to locate this information until I bought the product.  After my skin broke out, I read the label."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great for under your mask!,"September 4, 2020",560 Medium,5,"This skin milk has light pigment. I have rosacea and it peaks through a bit but I don't mind! It is definitely buildable but I only put one layer on with a skincare brush so it could potentially be covered. With a green color correcter under, it could be fully covered. I focus it on my forehead and under my eyes since my mask covers the rest. If I pull my mask off there are no awkward makeup lines which is great because I frequently pull it down when using a face shield while at work. Very light weight and hydrating!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Awful powdery grainy formula,"August 5, 2021",570 Medium/Tan,1,"Maybe i am using this wrong. I found the perfect color for me. (never happens), but it leaves a grainy powder on the surface almost like pilling, and it’s weird. something abt the formula won’t blend well and adhere seemlessly to the skin. Ive tried with different primers and without one."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not sure it’s legit,"November 1, 2021",520 Fair,2,"I have this product, purchased from physical store, in a lighter color. I purchased this one for a better color match. However, this product is not like the one I purchased from the store. This product seems to have some settling, when the bottle is left on its side of the dark, almost black substance seems to settle out of it. It also seems to have particulate in it, which is hard and possibly tiny bits of plastic? I threw it away out of an abundance of caution."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Drugstore Brand worth the cost,"December 2, 2021",560 Medium,4,"For sheer coverage this product does not disappoint; however, it does not last through an entire day.  As far as pores are concerned it covers so so....I think depending on which primer you use it covers them differently. For the price and convenience to purchase it is worth trying."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,My favorite foundation,"April 14, 2021",560 Medium,5,"I love the ingredients and smell of this foundation. It doesn’t feel thick, it’s more buildable and lightweight so if you want more coverage just apply more. One of the only foundations that doesn’t cause breakouts on my skin, I have repurchased several times now."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Don’t second guess this. It’s incredible.,"June 4, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,5,You need this. I’m on accutane and my skin is extremely dry and will peel often. Since using this .: it makes my skin look so clean and fresh. Gives a healthy glow !! My skin looks incredible. I recommend using a brush and tapping it into your skin. Also y’all need to buy the winky lux diamond powder to set this. GAME CHANGER !!!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,HORRIBLE!,"April 27, 2020",550 Light/Medium,1,"This has to be the worst makeup I’ve ever used! It feels like glue sitting on top of your face. No matter how many times I tried, I couldn’t get it to blend or rub in. It was cakey, not hydrating and all around AWFUL! I have never been one to throw out make up, I always get it to work but this is absolutely unusable! So sad because I loved their other clean make up."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Move on,"August 7, 2020",550 Light/Medium,1,"Color was a match, went on smoothly but made me breakout!! Might be a fit for some. Not worth it for me!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Wow!,"December 9, 2021",,5,"Amazing. I used this over concealer on my under eyes and it looked great all day. Then i fell asleep in my makeup (a full 8 hours), and it looked the same when I woke up. I have very dry under eyes so they are always a problem to conceal."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I’ve never had so many issues with a foundation,"October 23, 2021",530 Fair/Light,1,"I bought this because I heard great things about it but have never disliked a foundation more. I usually have clear skin but this broke me out within one day. It’s a watery, thin consistency that somehow still feels cakey and wet on the skin no matter how much you set it. I’ve also noticed tiny plastic pieces when I apply it that prevents the foundation from blending in at all and I believe is the reason my skin feels itchy after applying it. I highly recommend not buying this foundation, I’ve gotten much better coverage and results with a drugstore BB cream"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Don’t buy this from Amazon,Buy at a drugstore","November 16, 2021",540 Light,1,"I’ve been using this product for about 6 months. First got at a rite aid. Never any problems. I’ve read a lot of reviews on here about having “white dots” and such. I only had that issue when using the one I bought from Amazon! Never from the drug store. It looks fine when you squeeze the product out, but looks and sets horribly on the face and you get these white dots . But never experienced anything like that when I purchase this product at a drug store. Please just spent the extra $5 and buy at a drug store"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Evenly but kinda sticky,"July 18, 2020",550 Light/Medium,3,"I got the right tone for my skin, it covers most of my acne, dark circles and scars but it feels sticky for a while, that ends up ruining my eyeliner whit just blinking. That’s my only complaint, so far I like the rest of the product, it doesn’t feel heavy at all and is easy to spread"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Best for under the eyes and dry areas,"March 1, 2021",,5,"Very smoothing and almost feels hydrating, love using it under my eyes and areas that feel slightly dry (around the mouth, under eyes, between eyebrows). I have oily combo skin, so I usually use different powders for different areas of my face."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,No safety seal… Not a new product!,"October 10, 2021",510 Porcelain,1,"I purchased this product in a store in the color “Fair” and purchased it here in “Porcelain” because my store was out. You can clearly see that the “Porcelain” was missing the safety seal and the weight of the tube is considerably lighter, further proving it was used. There’s no choice to return so this is going straight in the garbage!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Watery and hardly any coverage,"February 17, 2021",560 Medium,1,This is super sheer and you can’t build it. Doesn’t blend well with concealer and wears off easily. The only good thing I can say is that since it’s such light coverage it seems to reduce the appearance of pores.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Do not buy from this vendor,"January 10, 2022",520 Fair,1,Let me say I love this foundation (very light coverage) but not from this vendor. This product arrived and it was open plus ( so safety seal and in a plastic bag with a bar code) when I applied a small amount to my hand OT was chunky and wouldn’t even squeeze out. I will be returning.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I don't recommend.,"July 21, 2020",550 Light/Medium,2,"Unfortunately, as many of the other reviews have said, Cover Girl missed the mark on this one.  It sits on top of your skin in a very unattractive way.  I've used many BB and CC creams and the one at Dollar Tree works better than this.  I tried multiple times with different tools, lighting, and even tried combining it with other creams but it just doesn't work.  I commend Cover Girl for trying to make a semi-healthier foundation so please keep working on this!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight formula,"July 28, 2020",530 Fair/Light,3,I like the lightweight feel.  I don't think it lasts all day.  It broke up around my nose and mouth before the 8 hour mark.  I do like it under a powder foundation.  I found it worked better if you didn't moisturize your face first.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Would have been good,"November 27, 2021",,5,So I bought this concealer and couldn't wait to get it. Finally came and the bottle doesn't have any in it. It's like it was dried up or used because there isn't but a little inside.  I haven't used it but 4 times and it's empty. Not happy at all
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I wish people cared more about darker shades,"November 24, 2020",,3,"Okay shade match, a little ashy. Didn’t feel comfortable wearing it. The undertones in this line are poor but what else can I expect from the drug store? They act like only paler people wear makeup"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Sticky on skin,"October 29, 2020",560 Medium,2,So I haven’t used drug store foundation in a long time but wanted something cheap and sheer for a camping trip I went on. So it gives you a slight wash of coverage which is what I wanted but it feels sticky/tacky on your face and it just feels terrible on the skin.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,True to color/lightweight foundation,"March 31, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,5,This is my first time trying this product. I’m a mom of 3 and needed something to slap on my face really quickly to look ready for the day. This foundation glided on my face very smoothly and the color was spot on! It does have a funny smell but that is something I can look past. Very lightweight it feels like I have nothing on. I paired this with maybeline concealer and it looks great! Will definitely be ordering more!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great powder,"October 21, 2021",,5,I really like this powder. After having Cancer I wanted to use a all natural makeup. I have used covergirl since being a teen . This makeup is sheer and last all day. It does not dry out your skin. I love it.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Watery and thin.,"February 16, 2021",530 Fair/Light,1,Very thin and runny. Almost like water. Color is good but not super useful due to consistency of the foundation.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not a vegan,"November 3, 2021",560 Medium,5,"I am not a vegan, however, I am allergic to most Foundations. So I thought it was worth a try. I had no heavy feeling on my face. No itchiness or feeling that my face was suffocating. I am very pleased."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Ehh,"January 16, 2022",570 Medium/Tan,3,"I bought this because beauty influencers on tiktok told me how amazing this was. I wasn’t impressed with it on my skin. It’s probably great for younger skin, but not for 40 something’s texture."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,THE BEST EVER,"May 11, 2020",550 Light/Medium,5,"WOW! I LOVE this product!! It is so lightweight, and gives me enough coverage that I still look kind of natural but covers my acne and evens my skin tone. Such a good color match! Also, it is build-able but recommend to use brush first then a beauty blender. LOVE that covergirl is cruelty free now too!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for my dry winter skin,"January 15, 2020",510 Porcelain,3,Great shade match for me. It is light to medium buildable coverage.I think this formula is better suited for normal to oily skin.  It's winter and made my skin feel too dry and tight. I use it as a mix-in with other foundations and moisturizer.Will try it again in summer when my skin is normal.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Flakes.,"November 13, 2021",520 Fair,1,I really wanted to like this but after trying it on there were a lot of flakes. I tried shaking it but no difference. The foundation itself doesn’t seem that bad but the flakes make it unwearable.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Horrible,"April 11, 2020",550 Light/Medium,1,This product is horrible it feels like a wet lotion that never dry down it has no coverage at all and look horrible on your skin I would never even think of buying this again ever
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Worth the buy.,"March 8, 2021",550 Light/Medium,5,I needed a light weight and light coverage foundation and this works well! It evens out my skin tone to hid some of the redness. There are little hard pieces in the foundation like others have stated but I just brush them away. It's not that big of a deal.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Meh,"May 29, 2021",,3,"Not a good choice for older person. Settled in creases.  My shade was off too, but that was my fault.  However, I really applaud Covergirl for investing in clean beauty.  Keep trying!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Finally, something light enough.","August 28, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,Sheer
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very watery!,"April 16, 2021",550 Light/Medium,3,I opened the tube and gently squeezed to see product but wasted a lot as it literally ran out all over being so thin. The coverage was ok and as advertised (minimal) color was good but it didn't last very long. I wouldnt recommend it.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I really like this foundation,"September 17, 2021",530 Fair/Light,5,It's not thick and it looks natural. I'm glad this is cruelty-free so I can use it. Prob my favorite foundation I've found. Others are just so thick and unnatural-looking.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,what a lovely product,"August 6, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,"definitely one of the best foundations in terms of being comfortable to wear, i always forget it's there! its also buildabke if you're patient and need more coverage! also I'm a ginger and it's really hard to find a shade light enough for my complexion but this one is pretty close!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I loved this product!,"March 31, 2020",550 Light/Medium,4,I loved this product.  It's the first time I've used something similar so I was afraid it wouldn't look natural enough but it was perfect.  Despite only having three color options I feel like it suits my skin color.  I don't give it 5 stars because I feel it smells like food (something like nachos) and that's not good for a facial product.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Okay,"October 2, 2020",520 Fair,3,"I like the coverage and how it feels on my face, but o did notice that it tends to highlight dry spots on your face and the formula isn’t as smooth as I would expect it to be."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not A Concealer,"December 4, 2021",,1,I should have known better. The price was lower than most concealers. It came in a very narrow container (small). It dried quickly on my face before I could spread it. It didn’t cover very well at all. Wasted money.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Item dries my skin,"January 23, 2021",,1,I purchased this item because it was shown in a tutorial to be flawless coverage hiding blemishes with very little prep needed. This product leaves my skin feeling dry and cakes under my eyes. Will not be buying again.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great Natural Foundation,"April 29, 2021",530 Fair/Light,4,"Excuse my hairy hand, lol. I got shade Fair/Light and was scared it wouldn't match but it actually did perfectly. I am pale with yellow undertones. This foundation is definitely buildable coverage. I love the natural look I get with this foundation, it definitely even out your skin tone and looks like makeup isn't even there. I even got some acne scar, it doesn't cover them completely but makes them less visible for sure. This is for more natural don't expect anything high coverage ya'll but like I said it's buildable. Also love that this is cruelty free and vegan!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Best coverage,"May 17, 2020",560 Medium,5,"Honestly.. this is a great product. I’ve tried all kinds of BB creams and foundation that do not look like I’m trying to hard to cover blemishes. This one is the first product I use that does not make my face oily, and literally covers my pimples, including the dry ones and red ones"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice light coverage,"September 3, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,5,This gives you a nice natural coverage. It isn't heavy or greasy.I would definitely recommend this!! I also love the fact this product isn't tested on animals!!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Poor blending,"September 2, 2020",540 Light,1,Very poor product. Milky like texture and didn’t blend well. Left white spots that wouldn’t blend in. Almost felt like product was past its shelf life.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great daily foundation,"September 3, 2021",550 Light/Medium,5,"This product goes on easily with a sponge applicator, not streaky, great coverage, light weight. Lasts all day, even through sweating."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Smells awesome but a bit greasy and not a great shade selection,"July 16, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,4,Love the smell but a little too greasy and the color selection isn’t great for those with a rosy undertone ( colors are too yellow/ orangey so I have to mix it with a different brand of tinted moisturizer or BB or CC cream to get my right shade but if u want a sheer coverage that doesn’t need to last more than a couple hours this is a good product.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Different package,"January 4, 2022",,3,"Bought this mainly because of the package, but the one I received looks different. Newer version? Just a thin pink layer without the transparent coating. Hard to close. Hasn't tried the product yet, but like it is talc free."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It’s a No for Me,"June 15, 2020",630 Deep/Dark,2,"I had such high hopes for this product. Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. I have medium dark skin tone with some minor hyperpigmentation. I wanted a “my skin, but better” look, but instead got disappointment. I’ve used tinted moisturizers before and this is the most diluted formula I’ve ever tried. Even with primer, it still wouldn’t work for me."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not quiet Covergirl Queen But it's pretty good,"March 26, 2020",620 Deep,3,I think this is a nice drug store foundation. A little pricey for what you get but it is moisturizing. So if you've got dry skin like myself you'd like this. Look's can be deceiving when it comes to the shade. This matches me pretty good for winter. I did mix it with Covergirl Queen's *Soft Copper* and it was prefect.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice plant based/organic medium coverage foundation,"March 13, 2020",510 Porcelain,4,"This feels really light on my skin which is very nice to have, particularly when it’s warmer out. The coverage is moderate. It’s not full but not sheer either. It covers enough to hide some redness and imperfections but not all the redness I have overall without adding additional powder. It moisturizes enough to not feel tight on my skin but not enough to feel very hydrated. The finish is nice giving a satin smooth appearance. Overall, I would likely buy this again."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Mala,"November 13, 2020",560 Medium,1,Malísima muy grasosa y no cubre nada 👎🏻
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lovely fresh skin look,"October 24, 2021",,5,"Amazing powder, talc free, doesn't break me out and I have super sensitive skin.This is such a good simple pressed powder."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pretty good!,"April 5, 2021",530 Fair/Light,4,The foundation is a little thinner than I personally like but it is easy to layer on.  It feels great on the skin and easy to blend.  Stays feeling light and fresh for a good portion of the day.I think it is a good product for the money.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Sheer and moist,"October 17, 2021",530 Fair/Light,3,"I am 83, been wearing another cover girl foundation. I fell for the ad vegan. It was to greasy , came off on my clothes. Was very dissatisfied"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,sticky and smelly,"October 29, 2020",550 Light/Medium,1,Smells awful and made my face sticky no coverage. I don't recommend
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light coverage but ...,"March 11, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,3,This isn't a bad foundation. It's a good casual light texture that is natural looking. It starts out dewy but it does not seem to last  maybe it requires powder but that defeats the idea of healthy formula.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Shiny,"October 28, 2021",580 Tan,3,Leaves your skin very shiny and doesn’t cover very well. This might be amazing for someone else just not my personal preference
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Cover girl is no longer #1 in foundations,"September 13, 2021",530 Fair/Light,2,"I had high hopes for this, although I rarely use foundations any more. I would choose Almay over thus any day.  This is thick, hard to get a good match & shows up to not look like a natural blend on your skin. I don’t recommend this item"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Love it!,"January 9, 2022",530 Fair/Light,5,"Really like this foundation. Lasted all day. Lightweight, didn't crease. Color matched perfectly. Highly recommend."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very sheer and doesn’t last,"October 4, 2020",550 Light/Medium,2,"Doesn’t last long, it’s very sheer which is nice when you don’t feel like putting a full face on but still want to even out. It very sheer and not that moisturizing."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,So cacky,"November 30, 2021",,2,"I will not recommend this product, it doesn't serve it's purpose.It create more creases than smoothen the skin"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Works well with my skin,"December 24, 2020",530 Fair/Light,5,My favorite...I don’t like heavy foundations and this fits the bill. Still coverage but nice and light!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Sheer summer coverage!!,"July 18, 2020",580 Tan,5,I love the feel of this makeup. Light and goes on easy with sheer coverage!! Tons of shades so I found my perfect match.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice transluscent powder,"December 31, 2021",,4,Like that it does not deposit color but goes on smoothly. Meshes well with makeup & powder blushes.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Was wrong for me,"June 6, 2021",540 Light,2,It was not for me. It didn’t hold up to summer sweating. Felt wrong on my skin. Did have decent coverage and scent was ok.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,My favorite!,"October 23, 2021",520 Fair,5,It's lightweight and sheer. Just enough to even out your tone with out feeling heavy or sticky on the skin.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Didn't like,"March 2, 2020",550 Light/Medium,1,I did not like this product it has a funny smell aost like stale Fritos and it dried out my skin
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lovely!,"March 3, 2021",530 Fair/Light,5,"This foundation is beautiful. It corrects discoloration while still maintaining a sheer, lightweight finish. It is dewy, but it isn't too dewy. It just looks like healthy, glowy skin. It is moisturizing and just all around nice to wear. Definitely recommend for someone who isn't looking for a ton of coverage."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Great product, price could be better","July 22, 2020",550 Light/Medium,4,"Really liked this product, but the price for the size didn’t match for me. I think as a cover girl product, it could be cheaper. I normally get a cover girl foundation That lasts forever. I went through this quickly and didn’t even apply it every day."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Chalky,"September 14, 2021",510 Porcelain,4,Lasts long but makes my skin look chalky and I don’t have particularly dry skin. Probably would be better for someone with oily skin.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not REAL COVER GIRL,"May 31, 2021",590 Tan/Rich,1,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   Hate the whole thing it’s watery and not my skin color don’t buy listen to the reviews as I tried to cancel this order from reading the reviews they sent it anyway 🙄"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,WORST FOUNDATION AND SMELL EVER,"May 19, 2020",630 Deep/Dark,1,This smells horrible! And does nothing for your skin but break u out! Absolutely no coverage and noo its not buildable
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pretty and translucent,"August 28, 2021",,5,This pressed powder is very translucent and I love the pink case will buy again !
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very watery,"October 16, 2021",510 Porcelain,3,I usually love cover girl but this felt more like wet n wild then cover girl.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Didn’t look right on my skin at all,"April 6, 2021",510 Porcelain,2,This product was to thick and didn’t match my fair skin tone at all.  Was very disappointed.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Beautiful easy foundation,"August 3, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,"Light-medium coverage, and fairly buildable! Perfect match for my skin tone! Best with setting powder or spray over it, because the formula is a little on the liquidy side compared to other foundations I’ve used, so it doesn’t hug the skin the same way!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice and light for daily use,"November 5, 2021",520 Fair,4,Was looking for something light enough for daily use. Sort of a Zoom ready look rather than nothing!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Too sheer for my skin.,"January 16, 2022",510 Porcelain,2,"It feels good on my skin, but I need more coverage.  It was more of a lotion for me."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Maekup,"October 22, 2021",530 Fair/Light,5,Make sure you shake this makeup. Works great has sheer coverage and beautiful!!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It’s light coverage but amazing,"December 13, 2021",520 Fair,5,Best light coverage foundation I’ve ever had. It blends so perfectly
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good for fair skin,"October 8, 2020",,5,"All of the product lines, especially the natural product lines,  have concealer’s that are too dark for me.  Even Cover Girl’s  lightest stick concealer is too dark for my skin tone. Finally there is truly a fair skin tone concealer, and it’s non-toxic too and doesn’t tug at your skin when you apply it! Thank you, Cover Girl!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Do not buy if you're looking for good coverage,"December 8, 2021",560 Medium,2,Very disappointed in this product. Definitely not worth all the raves.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Decent,"April 7, 2021",560 Medium,2,I bought a little too dark. Sits on my skin makes it feel Dewy which is nice m not too thick and not too thin. Won't last all day. No build up to cover blemishes. I still use something powder over top to set it and try to make it Last.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very watered down and lacks coverage,"March 10, 2021",530 Fair/Light,2,Didn't seem to moisturize. It did not cover even the lightest flaws. Came out like water and ran everywhere. I would not recommend
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,horrible,"February 6, 2021",510 Porcelain,1,"awful, pretty sure this is a fake product. it wouldn't blend at all and just looked like oily goo sitting on top of my skin.. honestly the worst face product i've ever used"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,not light even shades/runny,"February 24, 2020",510 Porcelain,3,"This is the lightest shade that cover girl has for a bb cream however it is still very dark and on the orange-y side. I liked the matte formula better than this one, that one stuck to your face more. This one is more runny and does not want to stick on your face even with a primer."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great foundation,"October 6, 2020",540 Light,4,"I loveeee this foundation. I have tried so many others, and this one gives me the coverage I need and its not orange looking. Its Almost perfect for my skin tone"

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Quality of product,"October 15, 2020",580 Tan,4,Bought for a friend she loves how it feels on her face
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Disappointing,"December 30, 2020",520 Fair,1,"It comes out like water, way too thin to apply. And the color is much lighter than it appears. Doesnt have as much coverage as I like."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not oily!!!,"January 7, 2021",,4,I like the fact that it does not make my face feel oily! Great foundation!!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I love that it us cruelty free.,"December 5, 2020",530 Fair/Light,3,It definitely works better than I expected. It doesn't seem to work all day but it is a good light foundation. I do wish they would package it better though. Almost every other time I recieve my order the pressed powder has gotten broken apart.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Too light,"June 28, 2021",,3,Shade is too light and there is no real coverage

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not impressed,"July 23, 2020",520 Fair,2,"Sits on top of skin, doesn’t blend in well, “oily” look after part of a days wear. Weird little grainy texture in the foundation itself."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good product,"December 15, 2021",,5,Goes on evenly and covers blemishes.  Looks natural.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Black stuff in product,"December 30, 2021",530 Fair/Light,1,There is black stuff inside the product. Even tried to shake it and wouldn’t go away.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Old product!,"April 15, 2020",560 Medium,1,There are clumps in my foundation! Maybe the clumps are from the product being old...
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It’s ok,"November 26, 2021",520 Fair,3,It’s ok. I feel like it’s a little drying.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light weight,"January 8, 2022",,5,Bought to keep in my purse for touch up
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Light and dewy, rubs off easy","November 17, 2021",510 Porcelain,5,"If you’re looking for something lightweight, comfortable, and healthy for your skin, this is a great option. It leaves a dewy glow look which i love but definitely needs some powder or a primer if you’re wearing all day. It’s thin and rubs off easily without additional product"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Its light,"February 10, 2021",520 Fair,5,Love this makeup! Not heavy or oily at all
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"This is a hard skip, save your money","April 1, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,1,"Product has a horrible smell and made my skin feel cakey, I would not recommend!"

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great makeup,"April 24, 2021",570 Medium/Tan,5,I've tried many and this is the best for my skin and price love it and will buy again moisturizing for my skin as well.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,My Favorite!,"March 6, 2021",540 Light,5,This Foundation is by far my favorite!

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Wack,"June 13, 2020",600 Rich,1,Everything.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Magic...,"December 4, 2019",630 Deep/Dark,5,This COVERGIRL clean fresh is like a Combo moisturizer/foundation. This could almost be used like an instant tan it glides on so easy and covers so well. A little goes a long way.  It instantly tints the skin looking natural. When it dries it doesn't crack at all. It doesn't cake or look powdery. It stays on looking radiant and refreshing. My daughter wore this all day and people thought she had been at the tanning salon. I think COVERGIRL has a winner in this line up. Absolute 5 stars here.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Smoothes right into skin, lightweight + coverage","December 20, 2019",520 Fair,4,"I am pleasantly surprised with this foundation. The coconut milk aspect is a little gimmicky, but the exceptional performance of this foundation allows me to overlook that . However, the ‘skin milk’ description is spot on.The texture is not the least bit draggy or dry or flaky, it smooths onto wherever it is applied with ease, and quickly ‘becomes’ one with the skin. It blends right in, is very moisturizing. This is a rare ‘perfect’ combination of not too runny and thin, and not too thick and goopy.It is certainly lightweight as well, and the coverage is actually more thorough than I was expecting. For my skin tone,  -fair is the shade I’m using -  the foundation blends right in due without a mismatch at the jawline.As mentioned earlier, my skin is fair with absolutely no cool tones what so ever. I can do neutral or even the slightest tiniest bit yellow tones. No pink tones. I have freckles, yet my skin doesn’t burn in the sun; my skin can acquire a tan glow.  I added this information to help provide an idea of my skin tone and if it may be similar to yours.There is one star removed; luckily it is not a deal breaker for me. The issue is that the product seems very filled and a lot of product wants to come out with the slightest ‘squeeze’ or ‘press, causing much more foundation than is needed. It also can be a bit messy if it’s not wiped off the tip before placing the cap back on.My camera has bad lighting, but I decided to take a picture of my face with one half wearing this makeup, and the other half not any makeup.  Hopefully the lighting isn’t too bad.I’ve been reaching for this foundation daily, and am confident this will be liked by many."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I absolutely love this - replacing my current liquid foundation with this one!,"December 29, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,5,"Never in a million years did I think I'd love a Covergirl product so much.  For years now, I've thought the only good foundation is an expensive, high-end brand name one.  Historically I've used Lancôme, Chanel, MAC and Clinique.  After trying this and liking it so much, I'm switching.  No kidding.Some of the benefits of this foundation have been stated in the product description that includes:  Formulated without Formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates and talc (this is great - no harmful chemicals), 100% vegan, all day healthy glow, nourishes skin with good-for-you ingredients: Infused with hydrating coconut milk and Aloe extract for a youthful, dewy glow, and cruelty-free: Covergirl products are Leaping Bunny Certified by Cruelty free International, meaning they're never tested on animals.One of the most important thing to me is good coverage without looking thick, and a foundation that doesn't dry my skin.  When I apply it in the morning, I mix 1/3 moisturizing cream with 2/3 foundation.  For me, this slightly thins the coverage but also provides the smooth surface that makes foundation look best.  This one, even when blended with moisturizer, works wonderfully.Like the story of Goldilocks, this foundation isn't too thin, it isn't too thick... it's just right.  It's not too drying, it's not too oily... it's just right.  This particular color is also perfect for me.  I'm really happy to have found this.I give this an A+, five stars and two thumbs up.  I hope it works as well for you as it is for me.  I hope my review has been helpful in making your purchasing decision.  Enjoy yours and have a very blessed day!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Creamy formula provides light coverage.,"December 11, 2019",540 Light,4,"This Covergirl ""Skin Milk"" is a very creamy product that provides light coverage. It goes on smoothly, like a BB or CC cream, and leaves a silky feel on the skin. The coverage is light, as I mentioned, but you should be able to build coverage by adding slightly more product.I didn't think my skin looked ""dewy"" with this, but it did feel moisturized, not tight or dry. Also, the product didn't settle or cake into fine lines. Staying power was good (I didn't touch up at all during the 8 hours I wore it.)I also liked the fact that it DOES NOT CONTAIN parabens, talc, mineral oil, or other questionable ingredients.There were two things that made me rate it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. The first thing is the color. I received ""Light"", which is far too light for my light/medium skin tone. I think this light shade should really be called ""Fair"" since it seems best for someone with milky colored skin. The second thing is fragrance. The product says it is ""Sans Fragrance"", but there is a definite smell to this. It isn't exactly a perfume smell (I can't really identify it), but it is strong, and definitely there.The aroma fades, but not quickly enough for me.So, those are the reasons for my 4 star rating. But if you have very fair skin, you'll be happy with this shade, and if you don't mind some sort of fragrance in your foundation, you'll probably like everything else about this product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,This may be my new HG!!!,"December 19, 2019",580 Tan,5,"If I had a $1.00 for every foundation I have tried....you know the story! But wow, wow and wow! I never thought I would say a “drugstore” brand would be my holy grail but move over $42 foundation this stuff is amazing! It is so soft, so creamy, can barely feel it on, and skin looks radiant and perfected! It has a medium coverage but is buildable. I used to only wear matte foundations and then I had two kids and two years and turned 40 and my combination skin turned dry.This foundation does not settle in lines or pores and makes my skin look refreshed - not greasy as some “dewy” foundations can - it blends easily and lasts! I am amazed! I will be stocking up. I got the color tan which I thought would be too dark without a tan on my nc20/25 skin but it actually blends out perfectly! Get this - it is sooo worth it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Lightweight natural looking foundation, not much staying power.","December 3, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"I have very sensitive skin and was eager to try this new COVERGIRL foundation.  This is a pretty light coverage foundation, it's very liquidy and goes on smoothly.  You do have to be a bit careful blending it or else it will dry streaky.I usually wear very light foundation colors but I felt like this in Light/Medium looked a bit chalky on me.  It doesn't have much staying power and rubs off easily.  It does feel very nice on, very light weight...you don't feel like you're wearing foundation.The odor of the foundation was a bit like paint or something, I wasn't a fan.  This did cause minimal breakouts for me, it wasn't bad but I definitely did have some sensitivity to it.  I didn't think it was really moisturizing or drying, it was just somewhere in between.Overall this is a decent foundation is you are looking for a lightweight natural looking foundation.  It was better than some for my sensitive skin and it never got oily or dry."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good, but not great coverage. Middle ground of medium. Worked nicely with primer and powder.","September 29, 2020",,4,"I am fair to light tone and have trouble finding just the right shade because I think have both some warm and cool qualities. For a concealer, I chose light because it seems to be neutral as far as warm or cool and has a good amount of yellow to cover my blue circles. I have the family curse around my eyes so I never look well rested. I also occasionally get hormonal acne.This did a decent job of covering up the spots. It's got a nice amount of product in the tube, and the doe foot applicator is a nice touch over a squeeze tube. I can apply a small or large amount wherever I need it and dot it onto problem area to blend out with my blender.Something nice about this product besides being paraben free, is that it doesn't have talc or mineral oils. I didn't feel like my pores were clogged up or just full to take away from some of the pigment. The yellowness to the concealer really balanced out the blue around my eyes and even helped with red spots. It's kind of a soft orange tone too mixed with the yellow so it also cover corrects. It's not perfect as it's medium coverage, but it definitely takes away the redness and draws attention away from the flaws.I used NYX primer with this, but I did use Covergirl Ready Set foundation in 105 classic ivory. I figured for a fair assessment, I really needed to use all the products in my repertoire. So far, no stingy or skin reaction. I haven't had any worsening of my breakouts and my skin breathes. It has lasted all day and I'm happy with results, especially for a drug store brand and price. It's currently $5.81-$8.99 depending on shade. I thought it covered well and took away the sallow look to my face. Someone would have to be right on top of my skin to really see how much work the concealer is doing. I honestly feel like I look like a new person with some concealer to hide my flaws."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Your Skin But Better,"November 29, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,5,"I don't know what I was expecting from this product, but I was kind of blown away by it.  I wouldn't call this a foundation, but more of a tinted moisturizer. The formula is lightweight and moisturizing. The coverage is very sheer, but I'm sure you could add more if you'd like. The finish is luminous and dewy. It's your skin but better. I'm not really a foundation girl, but I love this product. For shade reference, I'm a 300 in Fenty Beauty. The medium/tan (570) was a perfect match.Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Satisfied,"September 29, 2020",,5,"Very satisfied with this Covergirl pressed powder. I wasn’t sure if the Fair would work with my complexion and it does (for comparison, I put the Fair-Clean Fresh and the Classic Ivory- Covergirl Clean Matte side by side) and there isn’t much difference in the color because I’m fair/light skinned and this powder color blends perfectly over my foundation. I like the matte finish over shiny and this powder stays on all day and doesn’t rub off especially if I’m wearing a mask for the COVID-19. I also noticed the pad is new and improved as the new pad is more of a sponge and will last longer as opposed to the old cloth pad which falls apart easily (I posted a pic showing the difference between the two ). I would definitely purchase this product again as it’s great quality."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Cut the shine and oil,"September 30, 2020",,5,"This is about the pressed powder. All pressed powders come with a sponge pad for application, but I don't think it is necessary because I believe most people, like myself, use a kabuki brush to apply powder.I am happy with my pick of color. I picked one a little lighter than my complexion. It's flat. I don't expect color as I get that from my blush.The compact case is not bulky. It's easy to open. The powder is packed down. My own brush takes up what I need and then I apply it over my foundation and blush. It cut the shine, and seemed to keep it off.  After I did some exercise and I did need to reapply it. Expected.Holding my phone up to my face I noticed that my makeup was not all over the phone. I think that is very good.I write reviews because I like to read reviews before I buy/ or not buy. I am interested in not what the seller has already told me about the item, I want to know what the buyer thought that was especially good, or not good. I decide from that whether I want to buy it or not. I put a great value on other people's opinions. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision, to buy or not buy, a little easier."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"fair is orange on my light skin but works/looks better w/ their primer; settles into lines, drying","December 14, 2019",530 Fair/Light,3,"I have fair cool skin. This fair shade is a tad too dark for me, as well as a bit orange. It eventually blended in, or faded when dry, but to start my skin was definitely orange.This has the lightweight feel and barely there coverage that I like, BUT it settles into tiny lines I didn't even know I had. My dry skin felt parched. I really expected a healthier look and feel to my skin. I have others that I much prefer. The formula should leave my skin looking dewy and didn't even do that. As hours went on my skin looked dry in spots. I usually like Cover Girl products, but this one is a bit of a miss for me.Maybe your experience will be different.I'm mid 40s, take decent care of my skin, have little to no lines, overall quite clear.. have some pinkness from non acne Rosacea. I don't wear foundation daily but when I do it is simply to even out my skin tone and make me feel a little more polished. I normally go for a light coverage dewy finish.I'll try it again using different applicators, different primers.. see if anything changes for the better. If I figure it out, I will let you know.The pics I included are of the product applied in my forearm. One with a splotch of it to show color out of bottle, and one where it is a splotch as well as the look of it applied like normal and dried. Orange :(EDIT: It works much better with their creamy primer in terms of how the coloring turns out. Still more matte than dewy, more dry than moisturizing. Still not my fave, but now I can use it up and not be orange. Middle of road rating seems fair."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Great packaging, love the mirror and sets makeup effortlessly","October 13, 2020",,5,Alright first thing to note is I got it from a reliable source that these run dark so this is why I choose this particular color for my skin I usually go for about a medium since I have more beige skin with an olive undertone. I am mixed with caucasian and el salvadorian but my hispanic features are more defining. This power def has major kickback but thats most powders but I do feel like its more than loose powders personally but I will say I love the way it set my makeup it gives you a nice matte look depending on the foundation you use which I gravitate towards ones that aren't going to add to the combo skin which tends to be more on the oily side more than dry. There wasn't a smell I noticed. I love the packaging I think it works well especially if you plan on taking it with you. I did somehow get my little sponge that comes with it completely stuck in the mirror not sure what happened there but the mirror is a nice touch since this is drugstore and if you take with you it helps the travel factor. I had already heard good things about this compact powder prior to choosing this but I am glad that it wasn't a disappointment and overall I would purchase again.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not all inclusive- applicator is out of case!!!,"February 14, 2021",,4,"Cover girl is a trusted name for decades so, it was a good place to start when searching for a pressed powder compact. The item is from their Clean-Fresh line.. and it seems to fit the bill! Case is easily accessible yet,  protective.. which is so necessary with make up to avoid breakage!Comes in a clear/pink feminine flip top case (see photos above) clasp is not difficult to open!! Interior lid has a quality compact mirror… One you can actually see real detail in!**TBH, Im still holding out for the makeup line who decides to create a contact with a  replaceable pallet and save the planet and $ from tossing these out when it’s empty or spent… This would be the perfect case to do that with because, it boasts longevity in the quality all around!Choosing skin color online is difficult at best- however, these seem to be as described and photographed on website. I chose a medium warm- and it as expected. A rule of thumb when should always follow.. if between 2 colors, always error on the lighter side. Doing this worked out perfect for me.One thing I did not realize, didn’t like and the reason to keep me from giving 5 stars so, take note.. the applicator does not enclose inside the compact!! This is my pet peeve.. I understand wanting to keep germs from transferring… But, it defeats the purpose when applicator is freely shoved into a makeup bag. For myself, this gets make up applicator for yuckier then, if it’s in closed in compact itself. This will be a dealbreaker from me ordering again..As for Application and longevity: this has easy transfer and applies smooth. I do not use over any primer but, like to apply to just a fresh washed face. Easy enough to place evenly.. length of time before touch up would ideally be x4-5hr. However, I have made it threw the whole day without primping and still have a fair amount of coverage in the evening. I’m not noticing any shiny or, oily patches.. So, the product and self stands solid. I’ve also notes NO skin irritation or break out.. and that is fabulous especially for those with sensitive skin! I hope the info can help your decision.. feel free to let me know!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I Ordered Rich and Got Porcelain 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️👎,"February 1, 2021",,2,"Hi, it’s Glamorous Gem, hope you all are having a wonderful weekend,Anyway, I have very Oily Skin and this is my first few tries of trying to find decent makeup for my skin type. I first wanted to try like a light or medium coverage with something powder based that absorbs oil like this says it does.I ordered it in Rich, thinking it would fit my skin tone. Sadly, they got the order wrong and sent me PORCELAIN. I’m African American, I’m nowhere near porcelain. I had high hopes for this product, but slightly sad I couldn’t try it at full strength. But, I did test it in my cheek. It went on easily and smooth. A couple dabs here and there and if covered my cheek nicely. I like that it is lightweight and depending on how thick you wish to have it, you most likely won’t feel it there.It did hide my shine and it sat on top of my pores rather than sinking into them. It seemed like a very smooth application, leaving my skin slightly covered. They were right, it’s not best at hiding any major blemishes, but it’s enough probably not to suffocate you or your pores. The last thing I like about it is the fact it is a bit more natural than the liquid alternatives and less clogging of your skin.I really hate I got the wrong color, because I was looking forward to it. I have a feeling, I would have really liked it. I might consider trying this next time with the RIGHT shade and see the results. But, until then, 2 stars will have to do.PS: No matter the nature. I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews. Thanks for reading 🥰🥰🥰"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light coverage and felt good on my face all day long,"December 10, 2019",520 Fair,4,"At first glance this clicks a lot of my boxes. It's cruelty free which has become a MUST for me. It's also formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates and talc free -  another huge bonus. And, it's light weight. I do so wish it had some SPF in it though, sadly it does not.I have fair skin, small pores and it's relatively healthy minus a few hyperpigmentation spots and some dryness on my brow. I HATE heavy foundation and usually end up hating most that I try. I don't use much on a daily basis, just enough to blur the spots and dull any redness that may be showing. This formula was perfect for that. It's light coverage and felt good on my face all day long.I imagine if you need a deeper coverage, this may not work as well for you.  But I also think you'd be able to layer it rather well. I applied with my fingers and blended with a damp makeup sponge.It does come in 14 shades which is great and the price is pretty great. I'm happy to see some affordable and easily accessible decent cosmetics hitting the market."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Perfect for Aging/Combination Skin,"March 31, 2021",540 Light,5,"I am in my late 40's, and have tried hundreds of foundations, CC & BB creams, mineral powder foundations, and tinted moisturizers in the last 35 years of wearing makeup. I have rarely purchased the same foundation twice, because I have never found anything that was just right. My skin has of course evolved over the years as I have aged. I used to have very oily skin, but once I hit about 45, my skin became drier in the cheek and upper forehead area, but still slightly oily in the t-zone. In addition, I have some lines and creases that makeup tended to settle in. I do occasionally get a blemish or two (maybe once a month) due to hormonal changes. I had started to feel too ""made up"" in regular foundations, and the needs of the dry, slightly oily, as well as creased areas of my skin were so different that the foundations I was using just weren't looking nice any longer. I generally had at least three foundations at any given time, and would switch them every day or so, depending on which part of my skin felt worse. Dry day? I'd use a moisturizing foundation. Oily day? A mattifying one. Etc., etc.! I just got sick of the complicated process, and also got tired of having a full makeup drawer. Just on a whim, I picked this CG Skin Mild Foundation up at Walmart. Since getting it, I have loved it. I feel that it offers a bit more coverage than a true tinted moisturizer, but far less coverage than a CC cream. For anyone who loves It Cosmetics CC Cream, you will not like this Skin Milk. I found It's CC Cream to be extremely heavy and to have too much coverage. I preferred a medium coverage liquid foundation. This Skin Milk is a bit runny, but the light coverage is perfect. On days when I am feeling a bit oily in my t-zone, I put on a bit of the CG Clean Fresh pressed power (with a powder brush, not with the little sponge). The powder is great, as well. This makeup stays on all day for me. For someone with very oily skin, it probably would need to be touched up once or possibly twice in the day. I like wearing a primer underneath, due to creases/wrinkles between my eyebrows, and I have a couple creases at my upper lip, but I could get away with wearing this foundation without primer. (My favorite primer is actually Wet & Wild Dewy Lumineax, which has a nice glow to it. I'm actually shocked I like this primer, but it's very nice on days when my aging skin seems dull.) Anyway, I love this foundation. It doesn't oxidize on me. I do prefer the Light shade. Usually in foundations I wear more of a light/medium shade, but in Skin Milk's color range, so I tried light/medium first, but it was just a bit too dark for winter. I prefer Light. My skin is neutral to warm, and I am a redhead, so the makeup does not make me look too pink, nor does it look yellow or orange. Both the Light and the Light/Medium are great neutrals. To apply, I put the makeup on the back of my hand, dip my Morphe blending brush, and dot the makeup around my face before blending. I prefer putting it on the back of my hand first, because it is a bit runny, and having it on my hand allows me more control as to where and how much I apply. This is probably the longest review I have every done, but makeup is tricky, and everyone's skin is different, so I thought it would be helpful to basically describe everything, haha! The last perk about this foundation is that it's so cheap, so I feel that trying it is a risk worth taking."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Decent for wrinkles real good for dark circles,"August 15, 2021",,5,"I like that 1 this turned out to be a good shade to match my skin and 2 it's just dark and thick enough to cover the mild dark circles I always seem to have. Also a fan of the fact that it stays on all day, even when I'm out in the garden all summer and swearing like crazy. When I come in I can see it's still doing the job. Also it does seem to do okay at smoothing out the look or dry skin as well as moisturizing. As well as smoothing the look of fine lines and some milder wrinkles.I'm fairly light skinned but alot of cover ups, or concealers when they are an exact match for my skin, are so light the dark circles show through them. Either right away when I put them on, or within a few hours at most.  Either that or they are so dark or heavy that it becomes fairly noticble that I'm wearing a heavy concealer.  Not my preferred look.Some days it's just the dark circles. On others it's the constant freckles, either covering or at least blending them in a little so their less prominent. Though they have gotten better through the years I do like getting a little sun, and when gardening I tend to get more then some. Used to be 5 minutes of sun and my face and shoulders would be covered with them  Now it takes a bit more and they seem to blend better at least on my face. Though there are still days where I come in and I have a few (or a lot) of really dark colored freckles covering parts of my cheeks.  Depending on what kind of plans I have that evening or the next day, sometimes I just prefer to cover them or blend them in a bit.This has been just about perfect for that. Of course it probably helps that having gotten enough sun to get the freckles I do get a light tan in the process. If not it might have been just a tad dark but as it is it works very well.When I have a full pan on my face it still works for under the eyes due to the fact that it is heavy enough to do what I need it to do. At the most a couple of times I've needed to use a slightly lighter or darker powder style foundation to help blend it a little more.I've noticed if I take the time to put it on get it to the level I want it and then allow it to mostly dry before I rub the edges to blend it a little more it will stay on as long as I need it to. No matter what I'm doing or where I'm at.  A couple times I even went swimming and noticed when I got out it was still on. I will say when I get out of pool or lake I'd notice in the mirror that the water does kind of bead up on it. Which makes it mildly more noticeable. Since it's only until you pat your face dry and get the water droplets off of it, it hasn't been a problem at least not for me. No it is something to keep in mind depending on the situation you're in.I would definitely recommend this product, just make sure you find the right shade for your skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"lightweight, smooth, buildable, blendable","December 1, 2019",550 Light/Medium,5,"This CoverGirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation is very good.  Like another reviewer, I'm also not a foundation girl,. I don't usually use foundation every day, but this product is so effective and relatively inexpensive that I'm tempted to use it more often instead of just for special or important occasions.It's easy to apply, and it goes on smoothly and not too thick.  It seems sheer, but one application did what I wanted to cover slight blemishes, and it is both easily blendable and buildable.  It's very lightweight and not at all cakey.  It doesn't emphasize lines, which is my biggest pet peeve with many liquid foundations, although I think it's best to apply a light dusting of powder on top for the smoothest finish.  It didn't irritate my skin, and it was also easily removed with the usual makeup wipes or other liquid makeup remover/cotton pads.The product name ""skin milk"" is a stretch.  It did not make me think of milk, nor is color makeup nourishing for the skin.  The texture is very liquid and it smells a little perfume-y and alcohol-y,  typical for drugstore foundation.  But the product itself is good, so I'm not going to ding it for the name, which is just the marketing department trying a little too hard to distinguish the product from everything else on the market.I took a chance when trying to figure out my shade (always the case with drugstore makeup when buying online), but 550 Light/Medium was a perfect match.  I take a Medium Beige in Bare Minerals, but for drugstore makeup I was getting it wrong when choosing middle-of-the-spectrum shades, so I leaned a little towards the fair end, and that worked for pinpointing my correct shade."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I may have found a new foundation,"January 29, 2020",580 Tan,5,"I got this thru Amazon Vine so it's hard to get a color match.  I though because this says it's lightweight and in the color ""tan"" it would be OK so I went ahead and ordered this.  I have very fair skin.As suspected, it was not a color match for me, but it wasn't far off so I went ahead and applied it for a night out where I really didn't care if the color was not quite right for me.I have normal skin and have a very regimented skin care routine that includes hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and peptides.  I am fortunate to not have blemishes, age or sun spots, and because I have cared for my skin, I also don't really have fine lines and wrinkles despite being 45.  I generally wear very glam make-up on the regular and have disposable income so I buy bougie products.I normally do not use liquid foundation.  I don't like the way it looks on my skin.  I have tried lots of liquid foundations from YSL to Le Mer to Bobby Brown to Kat Von D to Neutrogenia to L'oreal - and they all are a hard pass on my skin.  I dunno, I never feel plastic fantastic, I just feel gross and can't wait to get home and wash it all off.  I typically use Bare Minerals, It has amazing coverage, stays matte, and wears much better for me.  But I'm open to trying new things because you never know what new and great products are out there!I applied this foundation over Fenty primer and Too Faced Porless pore filler.  I used a dry beauty blender to apply this on my face and neck.  This has a pleasant smell and is in fact a light coverage and oh boy, it applied like a dream.  It went on very very smooth and blended out better then all the other brands listed above.  It felt just like a moisturizer on my skin and again, a light coverage so it just softens your face and neck wonderfully.  I could totally imagine this buildable as well.  Next I did Bare Minerals mineral veil, (I don't use concealer, I also tend to hate how it looks), followed by Anastasia contour and highlight, blush, eyes and lips.  I finished with Urban Decay setting spray.My skin looked amazing (despite being about 2 shades too dark).  I went out, ate, drank, went to a concert, and did a bit of dancing.  Make-up didn't budge and still looked almost flawless by the time I got home.  I didn't feel like I was wearing caked make up at all!I am going to buy this in my correct shade for sure.  Highly recommend."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great For Retouch!,"November 16, 2020",,5,"I have a combination skin and when my t-zone gets oily, it looks like you could fry an egg on it! When I got this a few months ago, I am pleasantly surprised that it actually does a good job at mattifying my oily skin! The one I am currently using is in the shade Translucent so I can't really say much about coverage. The formulation does not appear white on the skin and does not have any overpowering fragrance. And it's 100% vegan without talc and other nonsense so it did not cause any breakouts. Plus, knowing it is cruelty-free made me feel guilt-less wearing it. The only thing I did not like was the packaging cracked within 24 hours of receiving it, I don't know if it's just a bad batch. Regardless of that, it does not affect the quality of the product and I could definitely recommend this to other girls with oily skin!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I’m torn about this.,"December 12, 2019",640 Dark,3,"I’m sorry I was pretty tired in my pics. Anyway as a foundation I hated this. Besides being the wrong color which is on me I wasn’t sure how dark, dark was. Well this foundation doesn’t seem lightweight. It’s thin which I guess would mean it’s lightweight also, but not in a good way. Thin means you aren’t getting great coverage. You want to good coverage and lightweight. I found this wasn’t great on my skin. It left blemishes untouched and it felt nice when I applied it but quickly turned itchy and was drying out my face. I recommend using some moisturizers if you choose to use this as a foundation.I chose to put this on next to one of the foundations I normally use. You can see the difference in coverage also the drastic color difference. This foundation made my skin look bumpier than my normal foundation.Subsequently this made for a really good contour. Since it was thin on top of my foundation it gave my contours an airbrushed look. So I totally recommend this for contouring I loved the final effect."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl makeup powder didn't work out for my wife,"October 2, 2020",,3,"I got this product in ""Pressed Powder"" option in ""120 Fair"" color as it seemed to match my wife's skin color.My wife used to use CG light beige pressed powder found in stores many years ago. So I got this in 120 Fair thinking the color on the screen matched her skin. But it turns out that it is very light and so her face is oddly light compared to her neck area after using this. So this is a no go for her unfortunately.The powder quality is good, mild scent is good, the powder puff is nice, the lid has a mirror built-in, and the whole container has a pleasant pink color to it. Great to carry in your purse for a quick touch up. The container is easy to open and close."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"After all the positive reviews, I really wish this worked for me : (","February 3, 2020",510 Porcelain,3,"There are so many raving reviews about this product, I am sure it works wonders on most. Unfortunately this product really didn’t work for my dry and aging skin. I typically wear a high end BB cream daily and was really hoping this would be a more cost effective substitute. I really love the natural elements of this product- particularly the coconut oil. The scent is pleasing and not overwhelming, and the product application is soothing with quick absorption. Unfortunately, to my horror - this product settled into every slight wrinkle (I am in my late thirties) and pore within seconds of application... I have honestly never seen anything quite so shocking.... it was as if my face was literally dotted with this product....it even clung to the fine hairs on the sides of my face. Typically, I would just throw some powder over this and go on with my day.....but I just really couldn’t get over it....had to wash my face and apply my normal regimen.. In sum, I think this product would be a lovely light coverage product for young and fresh skin, perhaps someone just experimenting with makeup for the first time."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Stops the Shine!,"February 6, 2021",,4,"I've only recently started wearing makeup again, since I discovered a facial antiperspirant that actually works! Even with using that, however, I sometimes do still notice a shine which is why I requested this: Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder, Tan, 0.35 Oz.Since I just started wearing makeup again, I'm not quite sure what tones or colors will match my skin. Unfortunately,  this powder is a little too dark for me at this time of year. In the summer, even though I use a ton of sunscreen, my face still tans a bit and this will be perfect for when summer finally arrives.I've tried it a number of times for review purposes, and other than being a bit too dark for me right now, it seems to stop the shine I still sometimes get. Being in a compact, it's easy to touch up whenever you need to it, and it tucks right into my makeup bag, no problem. It leaves with a smooth looking, dry face and that's just perfect.Overall, I'm very happy with this powder and look forward to using it more often as winter fades into warmer weather."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Quality Tinted Moisturizer at a Good Value,"August 28, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,5,"Light and dewy. I have dry skin and the coconut milk and aloe felt great on my skin.  This is not a particularly pigmented foundation--it's basically a tinted moisturizer rather than a foundation. But it's perfect for a natural day look, and for showcasing freckles.  In other words, it's great for making skin look even and moisturized, but won't hide dark blemishes (which will require concealer--I used concealer under my eyes but nowhere else).  But as a tinted moisturizer, it's a very good one.  Indeed, it's on par with Laura Mercier's $40 tinted moisturizer that I usually use, so it's a good value.  My only complaint is that the names are not at all descriptive--no one would describe my complexion as ""rich/deep,"" which literally tells you nothing about the color other than it's for a non-white person. Almost every makeup line would call this color ""caramel."" Now that people are increasingly buying their makeup online, giving names that reflect the product color would be helpful.  But that's just a packaging/marketing nit, five stars for the actual product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Buildable coverage,"January 1, 2020",530 Fair/Light,5,"CoverGirl Clean Milk Foundation in fair/light has become a great everyday foundation for me.  For reference I have combination skin, tone is uneven, fine lines, texture and acne prone.-I found that applying with my fingertips then smoothing our with a damp beauty blender gave me the most natural results.-it did not oxidize-light to medium coverage.  When built up it’s reduced the appearance of my dark spots by 50%. In one light application it softens them by about 25%-natural finish that leaves skin looking like skin :)-does have very mild flashback-did not settle into mouth creases-did not amplify my texture-lasts an average amount of time-as it wears off it does so smoothly.  It never separated or left me patchy looking.-didn’t cause acne-very comfortable to wear.  You quickly forget that it’s on!  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone that likes a very natural looking foundation.  As a busy stay at home mom I find that this gives just enough coverage so that I feel more put together yet it’s so natural looking that people think it’s my skin :)"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very Minimal Coverage - Very Moisturizing,"December 29, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"Covergirl, Clean Fresh Skin Milk Light/Medium, 1 CountThis is a very lightweight foundation and it is more of a BB cream with a sheer tint. It comes in 14 shades which is an awesome shade range for this type of product but I think most of the shade could blend into any skin tone.  I have a lot of issues with discoloration like age spots so I need something that offers more coverage.  I did find that this works well as a primer and base for my normal foundation.  It blends extremely easy with your fingers and can be used with a synthetic foundation brush.  If you use a sponge or natural bristle brush, it will absorb a lot of the moisturizing properties.I think this is perfect for a teen or someone just starting out with makeup and wants to even out their skin tone and doesn't have major issues that they want to hide.  It also contains coconut oils which can cause some people to break out.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Natural, lightweight and blend-able.","January 9, 2020",520 Fair,5,"The women of the house were impressed. This ""Skin Milk"" was natural, comfortable, lightweight and blend-able. It's labeled ""dewy,"" but we'd say it looks natural, as opposed to shiny or glowy, which ""dewy"" can sometimes mean. This is similar to L'Oreal Infallible (but maybe a little better) and to Clinique Superbalanced Silk (but for way less money).This provides light coverage, so it would be a great choice for a girl's first foundation or for college students. It has a nice weight for use in summer, and is vegan to boot! (BTW, since the coverage is on the light side, it doesn’t hide everything, so it might not a great option for those with rosacea, dark spots, acne, scars, etc.) In general, this might be a bit better for younger skin or for those with good skin. One last plus -- it doesn’t smell or feel like sunscreen, which many foundations do."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great everyday concealer,"November 7, 2020",,5,"Covergirl concealers can be a hit or miss for me. I have been impressed by this one so far.I use the concealer under my eyes and to cover any dark spots/problem areas. In the picture I attached to my review, I used the concealer to cover up a big scar I have on my wrist. You can’t even tell the scar is there.The concealer lasts through the day, and it works well for what I need.I’m not sure how to tell if it’s actually hydrating my skin, but it doesn’t dry out through the day. I have dry skin, so I can take any hydrating I can get.The price is reasonable for the quality you receive. I would say this concealer is pretty competitive to some other more expensive, prestige brands I have tried.I have used this every day for almost a month, and I still have plenty of product left.The shade also was perfect for me. I have light skin. I always purchase light shades in concealer, and the shade was as expected."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Similar to a bb cream,"December 15, 2019",510 Porcelain,5,"The COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Skin Milk is like a bb cream but give more coverage than your typical bb cream.  The coverage is light but good.  It also is moisturizing without causing breakouts.  It goes on smoothly, and feels good on the skin.  It doesn’t have any harsh ingredients which makes it feel like a higher priced foundation. As far as I can see it does not offer any sunscreen protection which would make it perfect.The color is good and doesn’t turn orange like some cheaper foundations tend to do.It doesn’t have any strong scent.I like to wear COVERGIRL if I’m out of my regular higher end foundation.If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review."

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great staying power. Keeps me shine-free.,"September 29, 2020",,4,"I used to use COVERGIRL pressed powder years ago, and was excited for the chance to revisit a product that I'd stopped using. The COVERGIRL Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder is actually better than I remember (or else it's been improved.) I wasn't sure what colour to order for my skin tone, so I decided just to play it safe with the Translucent.The powder comes neatly packaged in a compact with a puff/sponge sort of applicator that fits inside the compact when it's closed. The compact itself has a mirror inside the lid for easy application on the go. The translucent pressed powder is bright white, and it has to be used sparingly, or else it does show up white on skin. I am very pale with light blonde hair, and still I could see some white powder (particularly around the hairline) when I first applied it. Tapping the applicator gently against the pressed powder rather than wiping it to get product ensures that I don't end up with too much powder on the puff applicator, and now that I've gotten used to how to apply it, I don't have as much of an issue with the product making my skin look white in spots. That said, I would honestly not recommend the translucent colour choice to anyone with darker skin or hair, because I think it's much more likely to show up and look like a bit of baby powder on skin. Try to go with a match closest to your skin tone instead, if possible.The formula is awesome. It's super lightweight, and doesn't leave my face feeling dirty or cakey. I do have very oily skin and this stuff actually mattifies my face nicely, and keeps me looking matte and clean for HOURS without needing to be reapplied. I'm really surprised by the performance, as I'd switched years ago from drug store pressed powders to pricey department store brands, and they need to be reapplied much more frequently than the COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Pressed Powder. One thing to note is that while this powder does eliminate shine and keep my skin from looking oily, it doesn't really provide much coverage at all (at least not in the translucent colour.) All of my blemishes, flaws, and imperfections can be easily seen through this powder. They are maybe SLIGHTLY blurred, but it doesn't do the job of a powder foundation. I will still have to wear foundation and concealer beneath this product, but I'll definitely be using it regularly going forward as almost a setting powder on my face, and I plan to pack it in my purse for touch ups when I've got a long day and start to get a bit shiny again.Overall, this is a great product, and I'm glad it has re-entered my life. I would have rated it 5 stars, but decided to take off a star because of the visible white powder left around my hairline, and the fact that it doesn't really do much to even out the look of my skin and imperfections. If you are looking for a basic oil control product however, this stuff is awesome. If you're young and have a real oil control problem, throw some oil blotting papers and this compact in your purse, and you'll be all set. I promise. Great stuff."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good for under eyes, not red blemishes","September 19, 2020",,5,"My usual makeup routine for my face is Missha BB cream (+21) for a main foundation,  a concealor, and then L’Oreal true match loose foundation powder In Soft Ivory. I haven’t strayed from this for *years* although I do switch the concealor up because I find I’m not too picky about it.This concealor is decent. It blends really well and wore fine all day without any major noticeable issues. It it light-medium coverage, and I wouldn’t recommend it for use on acne. I had one red blemish (you may be able to see in photos, on my upper lip area) and the concealor did very little to hide it even when gently patted on in a few layers. However, I feel it did brighten up my under-eyes as I prefer."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Really Nice, Hydrating Concealer! GREAT FOR DRY SKIN!","October 5, 2020",,4,"This is a really nice, hydrating concealer. I have normal to dry skin, more on the drier side. My under eyes are definitely a drier area. So I’ve had trouble finding a concealer that doesn’t accentuate the dryness but covers my dark circles.The doe foot applicator is smaller, which is nice for the under eye area. It doesn’t provide too much product, but provides enough. With some of the bigger doe foot applicators, I find I end up having to wipe some off the applicator on the endless of the tube. So, I liked I didn’t have to do that with this!I got it in the shade Fair. I provided a picture with swatches - one with a good amount on to show the shade, one with a thin layer, and one blended in a little.I like that it has such great ingredients like coconut milk and aloe.It is very lightweight. It doesn’t feel like you have anything on. It has a thin consistency, which I like, but worried it wouldn’t cover my dark circles. It went on nicely under my eyes, didn’t accentuate the dryness, actually was very hydrating. It wasn’t full coverage, but if I put it on and let it set for a bit and then blended it out, I got more coverage that way. I do that a lot with thinner formulas or formulas that don’t provide great coverage at first, and that usually seems to help. This concealer was no different. So, I was happy with that. Some of the darkness still peeked through, but I was happily surprised it wasn’t more. I like using this for my no makeup, makeup days. Gives me good coverage for that.I love how hydrating it feels under my eyes. With my drier under eyes I don’t get that often with concealers, so I’m loving that! I love that it has more of a dewy finish too. My dry skin is loving this!Overall, I think this is a really good concealer. If you’re looking for something that’s super full coverage and nothing is going to peek through, then this isn’t for you. If you’re looking for something that will have decent coverage and be hydrating, you should try this out."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Moisturizing and Covers very well!,"February 4, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,4,"I received the Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin milk Rich/Deep. In other brands, I usually get a caramel shade which works best for me. This shade was a tad bit too light for me. Maybe the 620/Deep would have been better. The 620 looked a little dark on the sample on the page. The company states that it is light coverage. However, it covers very well. I have a dark berry color birthmark on the face and this foundation covered it very well. It did not take a lot of the product to cover it.I am a baby boomer and my skin is dry and dull. Also, the turnover of new skin cells is very slow as we age.  Before I applied the Covergirl I always use a moisturizer and concealer before foundation.Then I applied Covergirl. It was moisturizing it did not go on dry.  It applied very easily. I did not get transfer of makeup to clothes which is a plus. I use a beauty blender.  It does evens out my skin and flaws very well. It does have a nice glow to it.All in all, it is a good product I just got to get the correct shade. It does not take much product for coverage and moisturizing. It is 100% vegan and Certified by Cruelty-free International meaning no testing on Animals."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,The color options are lacking and the coverage doesn't last,"September 2, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,3,"I've tried this with and without primer and with and without setting spray and setting powder and it's a decent tinted moisturizer for a few hours but it doesn't offer enough coverage to me to be able to confidently call this a foundation unless you intend on really packing this stuff on your face. It does the bare minimum coverage like if you mixed foundation with moisturizer and applied that you'd get the same coverage, it's just a kiss of of foundation for a no makeup look. Plus it fades extremely fast, like by the end of the night when I go to wipe it off there is next to no color on the makeup towel because it just fades, but around my eyes and lips and nose it sinks into the contours of the face.That being said I really expected cover girl, a brand we've all grown up seeing on the racks of drug stores, to do better with these colors 14 shades? Really? I'm not impressed in the slightest with that, I'm on the lighter side of caramel colored and I don't ever recall being a Rich/Deep ever if I put this on my sister who is a true rich deep chocolate this would look bizarre. Maybelline Fit Me is way more inclusive with their colors and they have a true buildable coverage, you can use a tiny amount and cover your entire face for a natural look or use more for a full coverage look."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Pretty good, but has some drawbacks","October 1, 2020",,4,"My overall impression of this concealer is good and I do think it's a good product and a proper value.The consistency is pretty much in line with the quality you typically expect in this price range.  It's not super thick but it covers okay.  I found if I used moisturizer under my makeup and used this concealer, it creased badly in the undereye area.  I do live in the South where it's very hot and humid, however, so this can happen with some cosmetics here depending upon their ingredients.Coverage wise, I give it about a 7 out of 10, which is pretty good for this price range.  I have dark undeye circles because, well, I have a toddler.  This did a decent job covering most of the darkness, but I have a few stubborn areas that seem to only be covered by very good, very thick concealer.  Overall my general feedback is that the product could be a little thicker for my personal taste, but again for this price, it delivers pretty well.  Using a setting powder and avoiding hot/humid outdoor time will probably be the best way to go with this particular concealer, but as long those aren't issues for you, you should be happy with your purchase."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great formula for humid climates!,"July 22, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,4,"I ended up really liking this formula.  First, off it has much higher coverage than you would think for how thin/runny the product it.  To me, this feels more like a BB cream meets foundation type of product. As with most makeup, there is a slight smell to the product but it very subtle. It is not a ""fragranced"" smell from perfumes added to the product. I truly think it smells like makeup before the ""pleasant"" smells are added.I have extreemly sensitive skin and this foundation didn't bother me at all. I was extremely surprised as I tend to be limited to what foundations my face will tolerate.  This lasted me through an 8 hr work day and still looks fine.  I don't think it has what I would call a dewy finish but it doesn't dry down completely matt either.  Overall I am very satisfied with this product and will finish the entire tube."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Applicator and formula are great,"September 19, 2020",,5,"I'm going to say this: straight up, I'm a teacher who just started the school year and I am starting to look as exhausted as I feel. Zoom doesn't help make me look any better either, which was why I was excited to try something for my under the eye bags.I knew I looked bad when my husband actually told me I looked tired.The last time I tried a Covergirl concealer, I was 14 using a stick tube and dabbing my face trying to blend awkward lines because I was never able to get a great shade match. I got the Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer in Fair Light shade, and I thought that migh've been too light, but it actually evened out when I applied it. I dabbed a bit under my eyes and then blended it in with my fingers. The formula wasn't as drippy as liquid concealers I've tried, nor was it too thick that I felt like I was spreading putty on my face. I gave a really, really good stare at myself in the mirror looking for those awkward lines from the concealer not matching my skin tone, and there were none. I don't use foundation, so it could have been smoother in spots and YIKES my pores, but at least I didn't look like a teacher who had been up for 24 hours grading papers.Overall I'm pleased with this and will be keeping it in my car purse for those days I take a little longer to get out of my car in the mornings in the school parking lot."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great hydrating concealer,"November 10, 2020",,4,"I recieved this concealer in 310 porcelain.  I have trouble finding a shade light enough in a lot of drug store brands products but this is actually light enough,  it even works to brighten my under eye area great.  This is a slightly cool tone but leaning toward being more neutral, perfect for a concealer.  I would say it is light to medium coverage,  compared to the full coverage concealers that are on the market these days. It didn't cover my imperfections, it just minimizes them.  It's very hydrating,  the most hydrating concealer I've ever used and i really love and appreciate the fact that it doesn't leave my skin dry and crapey/ flakey looking like a lot of concealers do.  It doesn't have as long as longevity a's some higher priced consumers buy I'm okay with that.  This has a light scent to it, that doesn't bother me.  I think the price is fantastic, even thoug it's quite a bit less product. I will continue to use this."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great foundation for people that don't often wear foundation!,"December 31, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,5,"Really lightweight, glowy and definitely *fresh* foundation!I don't typically wear foundation day to day anymore because I feel a little too overdone with Fuller coverage foundation. But this formula is really great and natural. It's light but decent coverage that can be builder up if necessary. It's fresh and glowy without making me look too dewy or oily.I feel like it minimizes any skin texture and really just blurs everything out. A bit of a more liquidy consistency that is easy to blend with a beauty blender type sponge. I also think the thinness of the formula allows for the shade match to be quite forgiving. Wears well and I didn't feel like I got too oily or it separated anywhere on my face.I'm really liking it for my dryer winter skin right now and am hoping it will work for me year round. Really happy with this foundation!:)"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice light coverage for the pressed powder!,"September 28, 2020",,5,I received the pressed powder in medium and I was so pleasantly surprised! I usually wear a 125 in the Fit Me liquid foundation and when looking at this pressed powder I was a little concerned it was going to not be the right color. But when I put it on half my face it actually did a great job!It is light coverage so it did a nice job taking off the shininess and evening out my color but still let my freckles show through. It is so light on and not cakey at all! It came with a little pad but definitely don't plan on using that.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,doesn't settle into my fine lines,"March 15, 2021",,4,"I think I like this concealer!  Note, it is not full coverage.  It is light, so it helps to diminish the dark circles.  I tested it over eye cream and without.  Tested with two layers built up and also with and without powder to set.  It performed the same in all these situations.Pros:Great for older gals since it does not settle into my fine linesThe color I chose blended well into my skin tone.  Because I have big eye bags I did not choose a light and illuminating color. I want to send those guys back into the shadows so went with my actual skin tone color, maybe a wee darker.Did not feel heavyLight and creamy textureIt lasted all day without doing any weird breaking down.Cons:The product keeps separating and I have to shake the container. No concealer I've owned did this, so I think it is odd.  It's not a deal breaker though."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Poor coverage without layering, then it's too heavy!","September 26, 2020",,2,"I don't like this concealer very much. After I had it on for about 3 hours I find it very annoying and heavy. I feel like I just want it off, like my skin can't breathe with it on.  It goes on thin and sheer, and I can't get the coverage I need without two or three applications. It feels moisturizing when I first put it on but after a while it dries up and just feels heavy.  I got the fair shade because that's what I normally wear, and the color seems fine but it is not pigmented enough to provide the coverage I need in one application. Maybe that's why I find it so heavy, but regardless it either doesn't work for me or I used two or three applications and it ends up that it's too heavy.  I also found it hard to remove with my micellular water.  It came off but it took a while.  I have used other CoverGirl concealers that I like just fine, but this one is not for me"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not a fan,"January 2, 2020",580 Tan,3,I do not know if I received part of a bad batch but when I applied this liquid foundation small granules popped up.  It felt gritty.  I thought maybe it was counteracting with my face primer.  I then applied it to the back of my freshly washed dry hand.  Same little gritty balls showed up.  I shook up the bottle in hopes that maybe it was due to settling in the shipment or something.  Still little granules.  Not sure what went wrong here.But aside from the “grits” it gives decent coverage and feels like standard liquid foundation.  It is medium coverage but is buildable.  It had a dewy finish.  It did break up around my mouth towards the end of the day.  This does not claim to be long wearing so I won’t hold that against it.  If this did not have the “grits” I would give this foundation a chance.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good coverage,"October 2, 2020",,5,"I've dark circles. We're talking really dark circles all the way around my eyes which make them look really deep set.  There has been no skin care serum or product that has improved them so I depend on a concealer.  That started getting really tricky after menopause as my prior concealers just weren't sitting well on my skin anymore.This concealer said it was hydrating, so I got it. My old concealers were all looking cakey and crusty around my eyes. I'd tried extra moisturizer, specialty under-eye primers and a few different concealers. None of those combos have worked to both conceal and not look cakey and crepey until now.  The CoverGirl Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer is also less expensive than the other ones I tried ,so a huge plus.The concealer went on smooth and silky. In the pics the before is moisturized with primer on. The after with the concealer on. No caking!  No, it didn't completely cover  my dark circles and I didn't expect it to. It did however keep the area hydrated and brightened up my eye area.  It also provided a nice base for my foundation.  I'm delighted with this concealer!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight & moisturizing,"October 3, 2020",,4,"This is definitely a lightweight concealer. I have troubled acne-prone skin and dark under eye circles that I always have to cover up. I tend to prefer a heavier concealer that’s more matte than this one. This shade is pretty good but actually darker than most “Light” concealers I’m used to. It’s definitely buildable, and I find myself needing a few coats to get my dark circles covered. It’s actually WONDERFUL for using on zits that are healing or dry since it has moisturizing qualities to it. I HATE IT whenever a concealer ends up accentuating my zit because it gets too dry; this stuff actually helps hide them!! With that said it’s not as good on brand new “shiny” pimples (those cystic-like bumps deep under the skin) because it seems to highlight them.So, it’s good and has its benefits. I find myself using this one along with a more matte and full-coverage/longer lasting concealer on different areas. If a more matte look is needed you can always apply a bit of setting powder over it!Overall it’s a good price and a great size!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Foundation covers well, but has an ingredient not recommended by EWG-Skin Deep website","December 9, 2019",510 Porcelain,3,"The foundation has features I like and one that I don’t like. First, the good. It contains no phthalates, no parabens, and no sulfates. A full-coverage makeup, it goes on evenly and leaves a slightly dewy finish without feeling heavy. The color I tried, Porcelain, was a little too light for my complexion, but I’m sure there are more choices for skin tone to choose from that would ensure a good match. (I've included before and after pictures.) Cleansing my face after application required me to use a good cleanser, not just a few wipes with a wet washcloth.If the makeup didn’t contain PEG or PPG (polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol) I would recommend it. Unfortunately, it does, and they are ingredients on the list of EWG-Skin Deep website to be avoided in cosmetics because of contamination issues. I ran the ingredients through the EWG website and broke them into two separate lists because of their sheer number. The first group of ingredients rated a 5 and the second group rated a 3. According to these scores, a 3-5 rating indicates a moderate hazard."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Meh,"October 5, 2020",,5,"This product is ok.  It's not horrible, it's not spectacular, just ok.  The color blends in, but doesn't seem to stick around too long.  I used this under my eyes and it really didn't look like I had used anything at all.  Maybe if I had bought a shade darker than what I needed it would have been a bit more noticeable, but the color I purchased (which is close to my skin tone), didn't make much of a difference at all.  There seem to be no benefits either.  I prefer a product that would have nourishing qualities, or hyaluronic properties.  For the price, I would pick something that has benefits as well as coverage.  If you aren't looking for anything but coverage, I'd say go a tad darker then you think you need for it to cover up anything at all."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Works well for blemishes coverage, didn’t work for eye circles","October 5, 2020",,4,"I got this concealer for my teen daughter who needed a concealer for covering blemishes. She usually doesn’t wear foundation or powder, and only uses a concealer for hiding blemishes. Some other concealers don’t work so well for her without powder or foundation because on their own they become dry and actually highlight the blemish after a couple of hours instead of hiding it. This hydrating concealer works very well for her. It blends perfectly into her skin and it doesn’t dry out.I also tried it on myself with full makeup and  I really liked its light texture and moisturizing quality. It performed very well as spots coverage but it didn’t work for me as under eye circles coverage, because the coverage was too light and when I tried to build it up it started to highlight my fine lines.Overall, I like and recommend it for blemishes and spots but not for eye circles coverage."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Amazing concealer!,"October 6, 2020",,5,"This is honestly my new HG drugstore concealer, and I found that it performs better than some more expensive concealers I've owned. First, it's very hard for me to find one that actually matches my skintone, since I'm super pale. Most claim to be porcelain, yet are closer to medium than fair and look very orange on me. I'm shocked at how little product I have to use, too. It applies nicely and easily blends out -- whether I'm using foundation or not -- and I don't have that noticeable circle where my concealer was or have a blemish peaking out from underneath. I find it's long lasting, though I do set it with powder and spray, and leaves a nice smooth finish, not dry and cakey. Overall, very happy and will continue to buy this, especially like that it's Vegan, Cruelty Free, and free of some nasty ingredients that I try my best to avoid. Highly recommend!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light Coverage Foundation with Good Moisture,"December 12, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"I tried this COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Skin Milk for a few days and here is what I think about this product.The color that I received is ""550 Light/Medium"" since I usually use light tone foundation. The color of ""550 Light/Medium"" works for me. It matches my skin tone well. Coverage wise, I feel it provides a light coverage on my face. I like the texture of this foundation, it is pretty fine and blends into my skin nicely to bring a natural healthy skin look. I also like the Coconut Milk and Aloe Extract in the foundation, it keeps moisture well for my skin for hours. It doesn't clog my pores and won't cause acnes. It's a lightweight and non-greasy foundation. Also, I don't smell any scent in this foundation. I myself always prefer non scent skin product. So it works for me.I like this product and I will continue using it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Dewy Finish,"December 7, 2019",550 Light/Medium,5,"This is a sheer foundation similar to a BB Crème in terms of coverage.  While I don't have any dark spots that need concealing, I usually prefer a medium coverage foundation just to even things out, so I wasn't sure how much I'd like this.  To my surprise, this really does a beautiful job in creating a dewy, youthful glow to the skin as well as blurring the fine lines and larger pores on either side of my nose.  Unlike the few BB Crèmes I've tried the finish isn't oily looking but rather gives the appearance of naturally moist skin.  I honestly can't believe how much I like this stuff.  It gave my skin the holy grail of a radiant no-makeup look.If you have generally good, unblemished skin and merely want to improve its tone and texture, this might be the perfect foundation for you.  Oh yeah, and Cover Girl is now cruelty-free."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good ingredients, but not the best finish","December 3, 2019",530 Fair/Light,3,"I have tried a variety of foundations by different companies and formulations of their make-up.  I like that this foundation is made without formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates, and talc.  This foundation is lightweight.  The formulation adds moisture with a delicate infusion of coconut and aloe.Cover Girl claims you will experience a glowing, dewy finish that lasts all day long, blurring imperfections and creating a more even skin tone. I found that compared to other foundations, it does not go on as smooth.  There is a little streaking that needs to be smoothed down, if I use my fingers.  I can also smooth it with finishing powder.  Once I do that, it has a better finish.  I tried the fair/light color.  It is definitely is a light color.  I would say this is average drugstore make-up so I gave it 3 stars.  It is good enough to use occasionally, but I prefer my current foundation to this one."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light coverage with a beautiful healthy glow that lasts for hours,"December 12, 2019",530 Fair/Light,4,I really enjoy Covergirl foundations. One of my all-time favorites is the Ready Set Gorgeous which is a much more matte and long wearing foundation but is fantastic during the summer months. This foundation is a lightweight dewey foundation that's provides light coverage. You can build it up but it doe end up looking a little bit heavy if you do that. Like most dewy foundations this one does leave your skin feeling ever so slightly tacky but the trade-off is that you get that radiant glowy healthy look to the skin. I have normal skin that can get a little oily in the summer but in the winter right now this foundation works beautifully on me for hours without breaking apart. Because it's a lighter coverage the shade range is really flexible and will work for a lot of different people. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I like this and I'm looking forward to wearing it on days when I just want a natural healthy look.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good coverage,"October 2, 2020",,4,"I don't have dark circles, so that's the coverage I'm looking for. What I do have is duller skin, I think, and I like using a lighter eye cream under my eyes during the day that has some moisturizing effects. I use no-color eye cream at night, and I like using pigmented eye cream during the day.  This is a good eye cream. I haven't found the perfect daytime pigmented eye cream but this one is up there with others that are good. It's a tiny bit orange in the tube, but it went on and I didn't notice any orange tone when I had it on.It blends well and it didn't crease under my eyes all day and my eyeliner (under my eye) didn't smudge.When I washed my makeup off at the end of the night, the skin under my eyes was moisturized and healthy feeling/looking.I do recommend this because it's a good cream, but it's not the BEST cream (haven't found that one yet). It's AS good as others I've used and better than some."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very Nice for Keeping the Shine Away,"September 29, 2020",,5,"For my skin, this powder is really nice.  I can use it without foundation for every day when I don't want to bother with foundation and all the other stuff.  I can put on a bit of sunscreen before I use this, add a bit of powder, and it holds the shininess at bay for several hours.  If I don't put on sunscreen first, it's even better.It's hard to get the right color, and I chose ""fair.""  For me right now, it's a little too light.  I think it will work fine with my winter face, but not as well with my summer face.  But if I use a light hand, which you want to do anyway so it doesn't look to heavy, and if I add a little blusher, it works for my summer face, too.I really like that this is both vegan and cruelty free.  I have to act on faith that both of those things are true, but I really hope so."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,❤💕👌Good Milk Foundations but Limited Color Ranges NOT for Everyone👌💕❤,"December 7, 2019",610 Rich/Deep,3,"I bought this because I thought it was cruelty free  and the packaging was easy to squeeze out the most product possible without waste. It also is important for me that it LASTS LONG and MATTIFIES super oily and dry skin. The smell was tolerable, coverage was full and it didn't oxidize on the skin. It didn't affect the amount of acne on my face although it felt super greasy and it may have clogged my pores. It felt like my t-zone had more blackheads and white heads as usual.However, it easily smudges and streaks, its hard to blend even with powder... i used primer, powders, setting powders, mattifying powders, setting sprays... its just not natural looking. if I touch my face, the product comes off almost completely. My face looks the most greasy, it looks HORRIBLE with the flash in photos. I got comments on how shiny and ""sweaty"" I looked a couple of times. Also, I prefer a pump dispensing mechanism, this one is a Squeeze type.Also, what's frustrating is that the available color range only covers 520 (Light) - 640 (Dark), so if your face requires a lighter foundations, such as most Asians prefer lighter skin tones, you will have great difficulties finding one that suits your taste."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,No Talc In This Lightweight Foundation,"November 30, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,4,"CG Smoothers has long been my foundation of choice, but I was curious if Cover Girl’s newest make-up line (Clean Fresh) would do as good a job.  For a product that doesn’t contain formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates and talc, I’m impressed but not enough to make a permanent switch.  I normally wear creamy beige, and ordered medium tan in this.  Colors are very similar, and even though the medium tan looks darker in the tube, it actually looks lighter than creamy beige on my skin.  This is a very lightweight foundation—perfect for people who don’t need or want much make-up.  Still, I think CG Smoothers provides better coverage, spreads more evenly and is better suited for middle-aged faces like mine.  My skin is very dry, so I first apply an oil moisturizer (like CeraVe skin renewing gel oil) under these foundations.  That combination works well for me—my skin stays hydrated all day with no signs of dryness.Clean Fresh is a great choice for women who want barely-there coverage and care about the ingredients they put on their face.  I still prefer the slightly thicker texture that CG Smoothers provides, even though it contains some additives.  Even so, I’m not sure anyone but myself would notice a difference between these two products.  It’s nice that Cover Girl gives us so many foundation choices, and they all work well."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Free from harmful agents!,"December 5, 2019",620 Deep,4,"I have always avoided wearing foundation and concealer due the the highly sensitive skin I have but also because of all the nasty harmful agents added to them so applause to covergirl for this product!Choosing paraben-free makeup with natural preservatives is one of the best ways to ensure that you’re avoiding harmful chemicals in your cosmetics especially foundation where its easily absorbed into your skin.This is lightweight, medium coverage but a tad too dark for my skin. This shade will possibly work in the midst of summer."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great for mature skin!,"January 10, 2021",,5,"I purchased this cover girl pressed powder through the Amazon vine program. I used to always use cover girl when it came to pressed powder. Then, I stopped because I started using no color setting powder. I went back to using BB cream foundation and I feel because it’s so sheer and dewy, I need more coverage on my T zone. So, that’s why I ordered this pressed powder. I literally use it as setting powder on my T zone and I like it better than setting powder. There is no scent... and the color I chose is medium and it matches my skin tone perfectly. The foam puff is vegan... which is great if that’s an issue for you. However, I don’t use the puff,  I use my setting powder brush. The powder is lightweight... so it doesn’t feel heavy or irritating on your face. I am 50, so I have mature skin and have to be careful of powder products settling into my fine lines. There was no issues with this powder."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"NOURISHING AND LIGHTWEIGHT IN A  ""FEELS LIKE I'M NOT REALLY WEARING ANY FOUNDATION"" WAY","December 29, 2019",540 Light,4,"""Dewy finish"" foundation is my preference and I'm also a big fan of Covergirl products, but I jumped the gun a bit in ordering this product without realizing that Light (540) was actually on the dark side for me (a bit orangey).  I didn't know until it was too late that there were several lighter shades below this one.  However, the coverage is fairly sheer, but somewhat buildable, to cover imperfections that aren't too  dark or noticeable.  It is moisturizing -- what could be better for the skin than coconut milk and aloe ingredients? --  but not as much as I like for my dry skin. For everyday around the house, I would definitely wear this foundation in the right shade.  It has a bit of the typical, slightly chemical foundation smell, but nothing bothersome.  As described, it certainly feels clean and fresh, as further underscored by the nourishing ""skin milk"" tag on the tube.  Actually, it doesn't feel like wearing any foundation at all (very breathable), and I appreciate that it doesn't contain chemicals known to be skin irritants. Might be best for younger women that don't need much coverage or additional moisturizer.  Good product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,610 Deep/Rich - working well,"August 25, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,4,"Overall this product is ok. I apply it with a makeup brush, so not sure how it works with sponges but should be fine too.PROS:- It's very light, it doesn't seem like you're wearing foundation, which gives my makeup a more natural finished. I prefer this instead of dense makeups, but this is subjective for each person's preference- Has a good variety of colors to choose from, I decided to give it a try to the 610 and it is just fine for my skin color- Easy to apply, its texture is very liquid and I liked that, but applying it with the fingers might be tricky because of this feature- I did not find it to have such strong smell, it says coconut milk and aloe extract as ingredients, but might be too low to be perceivedCONS:- Be careful when pushing the tube or you might get much foundation paste than needed- Seems not long lasting though, and easy to remove if it's not well dry"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl Classic,"September 27, 2020",,4,"This is a great pressed powder. I use the included puff and press it on over my foundation and I get a smooth flawless skin finish. Sometimes I feel it's a little too matte, but a quick setting spray mist makes it still shine free, but more natural of a finish.The shade 140 light is a good match for my light tone (for reference I use nc-15 /fit me 118/ KVD012/ UD30NN) it evens out without getting orange or darkening from oxidation.I love that the compact is sturdy, has a mirror and applicator puff. Simple, affordable and great for on the go!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Medium coverage and longevity - very lightweight and smooth feeling on the skin,"December 5, 2019",540 Light,4,"Not a bad first makeup, when you are just discovering what you like and don’t have much to cover. I always first apply hyaluronic acid serum, then moisturizer then foundation. Sometimes I do use primer and sometimes I don’t. For this foundation by Covergirl I found primer to be necessary to use for a better application. Also this foundation does wear off some so primer is a great way to keep it last a little longer. After entire day of wearing it there was very little left on my face so I can say with confidence this foundation provides light to medium coverage. If you have acne or sun spots or other skin condition that require heavy coverage this foundation might not do it. I love that it’s lightweight and you almost can’t feel you’re wearing foundation. Excellent excellent price here on Amazon! CVS or Walgreens have this at double the price."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,590 TAN/RICH = Greyish undertone on DEEPER Complexions,"February 21, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,2,"This foundation's tube spits out the product too heavily so be careful when squeezing out the product. The Tan/Rich color is a very yellow-ish grey undertones and it appears milky on my deeper skin tone. This product also NEEDS to be set with a powder since it DOES transfer easily.THE COVERAGE / FINISHThe coverage is very light and I felt like it only highlighted my imperfections, as opposed to covering them up as a good foundation would. The finish is NOT dewy, my skin looked dry. This foundation looks like powder vs a cream foundation (which this is).LACK OF SHADES / UNDERTONEThis was NOT my shade, maybe a shade off, but all the other colors appear as if it will have the same undertone issue being too grey, yellow, or orange. This brand needs a better range of color, especially since the undertones aren't the best.On the brighter side, this foundation is lightweight and doesn't feel like anything heavy on the skin. However, I wouldn't reorder LOL. I hope this helps :)"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Medium coverage and like the absence of many harmful ingredients !,"September 28, 2020",,4,"I have to be honest in that I am not a drugstore make up kinda girl; mainly because as a pale skinned Brit, it was very hard to find light enough shades in my local drug store, but the likes of the more expensive brands carried in the likes of Sephora always had options for me. Right now my go to which I love is Too Faced Born this Way.However I was curious to try this as the shade - Porcelain -seemed light enough  and it was. The coverage is medium, I tend to like a more full coverage but this felt nice and light on the skin and I really like the fact that its a  vegan formula and  is made without phthalates, mineral oil, formaldehyde,  parabens and sulfates. It is buildable and lasts well with no cracking throughout the day, even in humid weather. It is very natural feeling and applied with a good sponge, works well and is a great option for the price point."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Clean, fresh pressed powder, perfect for on the go!","October 5, 2020",,5,"I absolutely love this Covergirl Clean Fresh pressed powder! I ordered the shade translucent, which is color free and to absorb shine. This pressed powder is formulated with tapioca and aloe vera powder to help aid in absorbing oil and control shine throughout your day, into the night. This shine control helps to perfect and even skin tone. It gives you a natural glow. This pressed powder is lightweight and does not appear cakey. The formula is vegan and formulated without formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates, mineral oil or talc. The packaging is a pretty pink color, durable and comes with a foam puff. I love the ability to just throw this in my purse and go! I have very oily skin, so this helps to tame my shine while on the go. I highly recommend it and will be a repeat buyer."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Maybe the best buildable concealer yet?,"November 3, 2020",,5,"I have some of the worst dark circles I’ve ever seen in my life, and that’s on a good day. Between raising a toddler and working the frontlines during this pandemic, the circles have just gotten worse and worse. My usual concealers just weren’t cutting it anymore. I ordered this on a whim and I’m really glad I did. The consistency is unlike any other concealer I’ve ever used, but it actually covers and is buildable without looking cakey or heavy. It’s more liquid than others which apparently works. It is hydrating without making my under eye look like a grease pit. The color works well also. I’m naturally very pale and the porcelain was perfect. It looked a little dark at first, but it blended well into my skin. The applicator is very thin and precise. I love that it’s cruelty free. And the price is great also. I’ll continue to use this to see how my skin reacts after long term use, but so far I’m a believer!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Does what it claims, just isn't super full coverage","September 18, 2020",,4,"I want to start by saying that this concealer is definitely not full coverage - it allows some of your skin's color and texture to show through. This doesn't come without benefit though, as it helps to keep my skin looking like, well, skin - I don't have that caked-on look that I sometimes get with a full coverage concealer and foundation. On that note, this concealer really did deliver on its promise to hydrate and not crack as well. It does what it claims to do, but doesn't do much more than that.In terms of packaging, I don't like the applicator for this product; it feels a bit small and for a concealer that covers so thinly it should really dispense more product.Even so, this product delivers on its promises and is really great for someone who wants a natural look with light coverage. While I think I'll reach for my full coverage concealer more, I will like this for quick trips out of the house on days when I'm looking kind of rough."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Just OK,"December 23, 2019",540 Light,3,"I wear foundation or tinted moisturizer almost every day, so I am experienced with the type of product. This ""skin milk"" contains a decent amount of pigment, far more than I was expecting.  It goes on fairly smoothly and dries quickly if a bit unevenly. I used a makeup sponge to even it out. While wet, it looks dark and lightens up as it dries. Instead of a dewy, natural finish, I found that it had a powdery, almost textured effect that emphasized my pores and even slight lines. I tried the ""Skin Milk"" on moisturized skin and then, when that didn't last all day, over a thin coat of primer. It worked better over primer, but was still powdery and matte.  Perhaps, ""Light"" was not the correct shade for me?  Difficult to say without sampling several shades."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Wow I’m Impressed,"December 30, 2019",510 Porcelain,5,"I am normally a make up snob, and I haven’t used Cover Girl thinking it couldn’t be as good as my higher end brands. Well I was utterly mistaken. This is a wonderful foundation, floating over my larger pores and not highlighting them. It goes one evenly and blends very nicely. I’ve been wearing this daily for over a month and I will be buying this foundation.The one minus is that it doesn’t play well with primer. But honestly I just don’t use it with this and don’t feel I need primer with it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very thin coverage.,"October 3, 2020",,5,I like that this concealer is thin and not thick.  It doesn't cake up under your eyes and settle into wrinkles.  I got the fair/light.  I have medium color skin with slight yellow tones.  This is lighter than my skin color but works great for under my eyes.  It really makes them stand out.  It hides all darkness under my eyes and in the corners.  This concealer does not feel oily or greasy.  It stays on all day.  The applicator head is small so you can apply a small amount at a time.  I like that I can run it right up under the bottom rim of my eye.  I use Covergirl Simply Ageless Instant Wrinkle Defying Foundation.  This blends well with it for no obvious lines or separation.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Clean & Fresh!! 😉,"January 2, 2021",,5,"I am happy with this face powder. I have bought other brands that were way too expensive and don't even use them because I don't like them.One reason is that this goes on thin and it's lightweight.I like to wear make up that looks natural and not caked on.A more expensive brand I have purchased made my face look like I rubbed foundation all over it and I don't like that look at all.I have even broke out with little tiny bumps all over my face from another expensive brand as well.I got medium and when I first saw it, it looked pretty dark but once I put it on, it looks really nice.I will be purchasing this again when I run out! 👍"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight and hydrating even on my dry skin.,"December 17, 2019",560 Medium,4,"I was worried that this Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk would be drying on my skin because it indicates it is made more for oily, combination, and normal skin and I have dry skin. But it is actually quite hydrating. It isn't dewy but it definitely does not cake or look patchy on my dry skin. I got the shade Medium which is just about perfect. I have medium skin that is pretty pale so sometimes I have to go down a shade or two in the winter. This medium matches my skin almost exactly.It is very lightweight, more like a BB cream than a foundation. It does have some coverage and is a bit buildable but if you have a lot to cover, this will not cut it. If you just want healthier looking skin, this product will give you that. The foundation blends evenly and well and lasts quite a while on my skin. It does fade a bit after several hours even with primer under it and settings spray over it. But I like to wear it on casual days when I am running errands and such. It just enough without being too overdone.Covergirl has a lot of good foundations and, while this is not my favorite of them, it is a good one for a touch of color and coverage. It feels very light on my skin as if I am not wearing any makeup at all."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great Powder for Setting Foundation,"October 8, 2020",,5,"I have been using this powder for a week now to set my liquid foundation. The foundation I am currently using is just a shade dark for me now that summer is over. This powder not only sets my foundation, but it is also helping blend in my color a bit better.This goes on smoothly. It blends out nicely and makes my skin look airbrushed. Pores? Where? This makes my pores look much smaller! It doesn't make my skin look dry or cakey at all. I do use a setting spray over the top which helps add just a touch of a dewy finish since I do have dry skin, so a full matte face isn't quite for me.Great powder, I am loving it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covers Well,"September 19, 2020",,5,"I don't wear a lot of make-up any longer as I am now elderly (71).  But when I do, I've noticed that there are darker shades under my eyes and above my lip, like a five o'clock shadow.  I decided to try this CoverGirl Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer and I'm glad I did.  It made my upper lip shadow disappear, covered a dark spot by my eye, and concealed the dark areas under my eyes.  It went on easily and I just smoothed it out with my finger.  I did one thing differently than they suggested.  They said to apply it after putting on the base.  I did as I always did many years ago and applied the concealer prior to the base.  That way the base is over the concealer, making it all blend more evenly.  The container is small so I'm not sure how long it will last, but since you don't have to use much, I'm sure it will last quite a while.  I do recommend this CoverGirl Concealer."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,The best powder!,"September 28, 2020",,5,"The powder quality is so satisfying and the color is exactly as my skin color(I got the medium shade,160)I’m so happy with that.Finally found the powder that works the best for my skin,it is very light but covers so good so I don’t even have to apply a foundation(which I don’t like at all on my skin) also the smells is clean which is always a plus in regards to makeup.It comes with a very soft and comfortable pad and a mirror which is actually a great thing))Definitely the best powder with a great shade."

They have added some new types of makeup. I like this Skin Milk. It goes on very smoothly but does not cake up or look like a mask. It is lightweight but I still got good coverage. My skin tone looked even and healthy. This left my skin feeling fresh too. I did not feel like my pores were all clogged either. I like that this did not make my pores look larger and it did not settle into fine lines around my eyes.Overall this is a really good makeup with medium coverage. This does not make your skin look dull or tired and my skin felt smoother after wearing this too.Oh, and best yet, it is cruelty-free."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight powder that’s great for home or on the go,"November 25, 2020",,5,"This powder comes with a round sponge to apply it, which I like. Even though I often use a brush to apply powder, I like having the sponge so I can easily take this with me in my purse. The powder itself is lightweight and applies easily on my face. The medium shade works well with my medium olive skin. It helps keep my face oil free the whole day without any skin irritations. It’s hard for me to find a powder I like and I’ve tried different brands in all different price ranges but I found a winner in this Cover Girl pressed powder."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,very light and surprising coverage,"December 12, 2019",550 Light/Medium,5,"This make up is impressive. It covers quickly and easily with little effort or special tools. I simply used my finger tips and covered several blemishes, spider veins, and flaws. It's light, weightless and invisible. It didn't look caked or flaky at all. It's not a deep coverage, but it really softened the blemishes, and the spider veins were hard to see in the lighted 5x mirror. There is no perfume, no obvious odor or fragrance at all, in my opinion. No burning, redness or itching. The coverage and quality seemed to last into the evening with no touch up. I have varied skin issues, am 55 and have typical issues for my age. Dry skin is an issue, and drying products are an issue for me as well. This make up is not powdery or drying to my skin, which has been a problem with some more heavy brands, with professional camera ready coverage.  The tone match is so perfect for me with the light/medium too, I'm impressed with that as well.  This make up is a good value and very competitively priced. I look forward to seeing how it does long term."

I get ready for work at 5 am so I want the easiest possible make-up regimen. This product definitely saves a lot of time. Just a small drop provides enough coverage, and the product spreads easily with just my fingers-- no bacteria-laden beauty blender required! I don't need any powder or setting spray-- just a light dusting of bronzer and blush and I'm ready to face the day. I'm in my 50's and have good skin but a few wrinkles in the corners of my eyes and this product does not settle in them or emphasize them at all. It also does not rub off on my mask (I work in the operating room). At the end of a 12 hour shift, my makeup looks just as good as when I put it on in the morning. The only negative is that the smell is somewhat unpleasant. Luckily it doesn't linger. The current price ($13) is very reasonable and I expect the tube to last at least 6 months if not longer, with daily use."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Made my skin look good but smells funny,"December 11, 2019",520 Fair,4,"I like this new foundation from Covergirl. I received the fair and I do have very fair skin and this was a great match. The coverage is a medium coverage, and it did not fall into my fine lines or in my not so fine lines. I am 60 years old and found it to be a good foundation for my oily/dry combo skin and it went on smoothly and covered in a flattering way, not at all mask-y, just a very nice refined finish that made my skin look pretty. However, it does have an unpleasant odor as you apply it, kind of like sweaty salty feet, I'm dead serious. At first I thought it was a fluke and I shrugged it off but I have used it several times and that smell is there every time I apply it, it's not my make up sponge, I use a fresh one every time and have tried 2 different brands of sponges to see if it made a difference, nope. It does seem to dissipate almost immediately so at least I'm not walking around smelling like feet but it's definitely there as you apply it. I almost gave it 3 stars because of it but I do like it otherwise."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Perfect for on the go touch ups without changing the look of your makeup,"January 12, 2021",,5,I use this compact every time I go somewhere. I love that it is translucent and doesn't change the look of my makeup. It simply gives it a fresh matte look.  The compact is made very well. It isn't like the older compacts that would come apart easily. This one has been jostled around in my purse and doesn't come open and doesn't fall apart at all. The makeup itself is wonderful. Cover Girl has been my go to foundation for many years and this one is no different. Covergirl products stand the test of time and I have put them to the test many times. This compact is perfect for oily or sweaty days. It will quickly make your makeup look perfect again in no time!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,FInally!,"May 26, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,"Originally bought this at Target and was SO PLEASED with it, I just bought 2 more on Amzn. At 55 years old my skin tends to be a bit dry with some hairline wrinkles. Loreal, Covergirl, Revlon, Rimmel, Maybelline...I tried all the matte formulas, moisturizing formulas, Olay formulas, mature skin formulas. liquid, cream, etc. etc. I ended up with a greasy & dry look with accentuated wrinkles! My skin looked OLDER. BUT THIS! This is a game changer, smooth coverage ,dewy skin NOT greasy. So glad I have finally found a foundation that gives coverage and looks natural too."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not great for oily skin,"November 7, 2021",580 Tan,3,"I have really oily skin and this product isn't for me. I pretty much had to wipe it off a couple hours after application. This would be perfect for someone with normal/dry skin, possibly even combination skin. Severe oily skinned consumers should avoid this.The color was nice, though, and so was the scent. The foundation is also easy to apply and non-streaking (until the oil production on my face kicked into high gear).I was provided a bottle of this foundation to wear and review; however, all of my thoughts and opinions are my own based on my personal experience."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Goes on white, but blends","December 4, 2020",,4,"First, the packaging arrived broken so it will not stay closed. That's unfortunate.It's super difficult to find the right shade when buying makeup online (and even in stores when your skin tone is so pale so many do not go light enough). Here in swoops translucent powder! I've already found a foundation I love, so I don't really need a colored powder too.Love that this is a vegan formula and is made without talc. It definitely goes on looking white, but slowly blends in. I don't feel like it cakes on. It keeps away the shine and is perfect for setting foundation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Just ok with light coverage only,"December 25, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,3,"This foundation is definitely only light coverage. I tried building it up to medium but no luck in that department. I used a sponge to apply it and that worked really well. The color I got was just a tad too tan for me but can work especially in the summer months when I have a little color. It blends out easily without any issues. It does feel light on your skin but leaves a tacky feel afterwards so you definitely need a setting powder to settle it down. I would recommend a translucent one for that.I didn't notice much creasing or caking or issues along that line. I have normal skin with minimal pores really. With that being said I had no issues with oil, since I have normal skin and since I have minimal pores I had no pores to really cover much. The minimal ones I have it didn't really make it better or worse, just said the same really.With all that being said, it basically was like putting tinted moisturizer in my face which had no effect on my skin except make it a tad more tanner. To me that is not worth it since I found others that do a much better job and the same price."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Very nice pressed powder, smooth look.","September 18, 2020",,5,"I don't usually use a powder on my face, but every once in a while I'll pat some on, just for color.  I almost almost always wear liquid makeup and that seems sufficient.  Today, I tried this Covergirl Pressed Powder #140-Light Pale over my makeup, and was thrilled with the final look.  I had purchased a new-to-me big Kabuki brush for applying makeup, and thought I'd also use it to apply the Pressed Powder for the finish. (powder does come with a vegan puff)  The powder went on so easily and smooth, and left a nice natural glow with no cakey look.  As to the ingredients, it's formulated leaving out some harmful stuff, but using some new, like tapioca and Aloe Vera to make it more environmentally friendly.  I only had one minor problem:  had a heck of a time opening the package!  So glad I managed,.....it's worth it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Lightweight, coverage similar to BB/CC cream but...","March 21, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,2,"I can't get past the smell.  It smells like coconuts.  But not like that sweet, fake coconut smell found in candles and suntan lotion.  It smells like coco-'nuts'.  I wonder if someone with nut allergies could use this?  If you, or a family member you will be in close contact with has nut allergies, I would double check because depending on their sensitivity, any up-close interactions they may have with your face could cause an unfavorable reaction.I'm not a health care professional so obviously, I think its best to be on the safe side and do your own research.As far as coverage goes, it's somewhere in-between a bb and a cc cream.  it's not quite as sheer as a bb cream but not what i would consider medium coverage either.I tried this 3 different times and i really couldn't get beyond the smell.  I think I was overly aware of it being on my skin which made me obsess about wanting to wash it off.I hope my humble opinion helps you in some way.Thank you for reading."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Cover Girl Clean & Fresh Concealer,"September 25, 2020",,4,"This concealer does a good job muting light discolorations or blemishes. The tube has a lip gloss style wand applicator which is a good size for use in small areas. For example I put a bit of concealer on the inside corner of my eyes which alleviates some shadows and brightens the area and this applicator works well in that tight space.The texture of the cream is light enough so it can be feathered if done promptly and layers can be added for additional coverage. It wears well during the day without caking and it did not need a touch-up. I detect no added fragrance which I consider a plus and it contains no talc, formaldehyde, parabens or phthalates. Good basic lightweight concealer."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Makeup has good coverage, wand could be more absorbent","October 16, 2020",,4,"I purchased this for my daughter who has just started to wear makeup. She wanted a concealer that would be light and not incredibly noticeable yet still provided coverage for the errant pimple or under eye circle. She really likes the actual makeup that is inside the tube, however she doesn't like that the wand tip doesn't hold enough liquid. She has to insert the wand into the tube multiple times for full coverage on all her trouble shots.. She said it wasn't like lip gloss that holds enough to cover both lips - - this wand could stand to be a bit more absorbent. But other than that, she is pleased with the makeup."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,The 340 light color is nice for pale skin,"September 29, 2020",,4,"This is a review for the COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer, in 340 Light.I would say this is a good hydrating concealer for several reasons. The dispenser gives you as much or as little product as you want which is great. The concealer also feels very moist.I have dark hair but pale skin. The concealer in 340 Light was good for me. Even though the color was good and wasn’t too yellow, I’m not sure If it made that much of a difference in covering up my under-eye circles. It works as well as most of my other concealers and it does feel nice."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great product but no case,"June 9, 2021",,5,"First of all, the color of this powder is consistent with the packaging, so you get what you pay for. I love the pad that comes with it, because it is just right, not too big or too small, and it makes applying the product very easy. The powder goes on your face very lightly and doesn't feel heavy on your skin, plus it blends easily with the rest of your cosmetics. The only thing I don't like about this product is that it does not come with a compact, so if you don't have one, you have to just keep the powder in the container it came in like I did, which is a little annoying."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not bad concealer,"October 1, 2020",,4,"Important features:Color: 320 Fair;Size: 0.23 oz;Vegan product;(1) The concealer is a small size. But it is good for me. With the small size, I can try it and use it up quickly (If I don't like it, I won't lose much.)(2) The concealer is easy to use with the tiny brush. I mainly use it to hide my dark eye cycle.I use my hand to show the color before and after using the concealer, see the second photo.(3) It seems not lasing long. The concealing effect on my hand is not obvious after about two hours."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Medium coverage, smooth skin","December 5, 2019",560 Medium,4,"This Covergirl Clean and Fresh Skin Milk is nice with medium coverage. It didn’t leave my skin sticky and is fragrance free. I am by no means a big make up wearer or into watching beauty vlogs, I just pick what I know and I have already had good luck with Covergirl. As you can see from the picture, you can tell a slight difference with foundation only vs nothing. There is a “dewy” finish. I also had limited caking and the caking that I did have was because of dry skin. The only issue I had was it came out a little grainy. Not sure if that is because I haven’t use it much or what but it wasn’t a deal breaker."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Product is decent, but packaging not so great...","October 11, 2020",,3,"The pressed powder itself is really nice - it goes on lightly & smoothly & blends easily.I ordered the Tan shade but it’s way too dark for me. Luckily, I can give it to my daughter who has her dad’s olive skin.My real gripe?The container doesn’t keep the “Vegan Foam Puff” separate - it lays on top of the powder. I much prefer when there’s a compartment on top or underneath for the applicator. Not a deal breaker for everyone, but a personal preference.I blew it this time since it’s tricky ordering makeup color from a picture on a screen + I’m not a fan of leaving the applicator on the product all the time, so it’s a pass for me.**THANK YOU for reading this review & I hope that it’s Helpful!**"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,The perfect Powder to finish your Look - Clean Fresh CoverGirl,"October 28, 2020",,5,"I am really loving my Clean Fresh Covergirl pressed powder. I selected the shade Light Pale and I feel like it finishes off my look well. I use a BB cream as a foundation and I have acne scars so I think this powder definitely helps smooth everything out in the way of coverage. I think the pandemic has brought with it an extra problem with combining make-up and masks so I have had to re-apply, but I don't think that's the fault of the make-up. This powder hasn't broken my face out and I like the way it feels and looks. If you're looking for an excellant pressed powder I would definitely recommend Covergirl."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"More sheer concealer than I was expecting, but it works OK for small blemishes.","September 27, 2020",,4,"This COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer was a little more sheer than I was hoping for, but it works reasonably well to hide small blemishes. I was hoping to use it to dab onto my circles under my eyes, but it's not great for that. To even out small areas or reduce redness on small spots, it's fine.I have super fair/pasty white skin, so the Porcelain shade works fine for me, and I like that I can dab little bits here and there where I need it. If you have larger blemishes or need something with full coverage to even everything out, you'll need something else, however - this is definitely on the sheer side. Depending on what you're needing, YMMV."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,A good value,"December 26, 2020",,4,I won’t be replacing my current concealer for this but it’s a nice cheap alternative if you need it. To me it was a bit watery and looked as if it was starting to separate in the tube. The coverage is light weight so if you have a lot of acne or are looking to cover acne this may not be the right choice. It didn’t seem to increase my acne though which I like in a product. I do feel like it was on the drying side a bit. I noticed after removing it a few spots has dry patches in my skin. But nothing that a moisturizer didn’t fix right away.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good powder, great price!","September 26, 2020",,5,"I really like the pink compact.The color was spot on!I didn’t use this with the sponge applicator that it came with, instead I used a powder brush.I used this over my foundation to set it.It applies nicely. I did a light application. It does have lots of fall out with a powder brush so I probably would recommend using the applicator it came with to avoid that.I found that my chin area did have a cakey look to it, but everywhere else it didn’t cake up.All in all, great powder at an excellent price!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Huge fan!,"July 2, 2020",600 Rich,5,"I am a huge fan of any body care, face products that mention milk as an ingredient, especially coconut milks  Milk is so good for you to drink so why not put it on your face.This covergirl foundation is great, no sticky feeling and its lasts throughout the day.  My face feels really moisturized after application and it doesn’t feel cakey at all.The tube is a convenient size that you can fit in your purse or makeup bag and its nice that its not glass as those tend to be too bulky to haul around.  The pink is a nice touch to the packaging as well."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It pills,"October 6, 2020",,2,"I was pretty excited to try  the COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer.  I figured the color would match my complexion well.The color matched...pretty well.  The problem was, the concealer pilled TERRIBLY.  I couldn't gently  pat it on with a brush or my fingers before it pilled up and gave me a rather unattractive, peeling-skin sort of look (not very enviable; I don't recommend it).  I couldn't wear it long enough to figure out whether it was long-wearing or not.  This was my experience.  Someone else may have a different or better experience than my own.  As for the pigment, it didn't oxide very much (a plus) and the feel was creamy.  But on my skin, it did start to break down fairly soon."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,My Favorite So Far,"September 27, 2020",,5,"I have a lot of concealers that I like, but this is my new favorite.  It helps that, for once, I didn't choose a color that is too light.I usually prefer the cream concealers, but lately, I have noticed skin breakouts around my eyes that I can only assume is from the thick, lipstick like products that I have used lately.  So far, this liquid Cover Girl Concealer hasn't caused any problems, but I am not surprised because I have been partial to Cover Girl for years, but don't use CG products exclusively.  I use what works for me.Dabs on nicely with applicator and blends easily with fingers.A good product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice coverage for pressed powder.,"September 24, 2020",,5,"Honestly I’m a MAC makeup lover, but branched out to try this. I’ve been wearing MAC for over 10 years and I’m shocked at how far Covergirl has come. The powder is nice, covers well without being caked on. The compact it comes in is nice, and oh how I forgot how drug store brands come with their own sponges. I’m highly pleased with this pressed powder and its coverage."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Excellent natural looking coverage,"September 22, 2020",,5,"""COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer, Medium, 0.23 Fl Ounce""...I'm pretty impressed with this concealer. It goes on feeling almost dry, but doesn't look flaky or powdery at all. The coverage is excellent, and did a great job of hiding my dark under-eye circles and some dark spots on my face. I used my magnetized and brightly lit make-up mirror and I could hardly tell that this was even there. It covered imperfections without being obvious. This is a great product at a fair price. I recommend it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Mature Skin Friendly,"September 18, 2020",,5,"I really like this concealer but if you are a mature woman be careful.As with any concealer, this one will find its way into any fine lines you may have.  A good makeup sponge or a few taps with your finger should alleviate that problem but I just wanted to mention it.This concealer is lightweight and hydrating.  I use it under my eyes and on a few spots here or there and it lasts all day.I was talking with my adult daughter the other day and told her that I was really tired.  She said,  ""You don't look tired at all, your eyes look bright and your skin looks great, Mom"".Lol, so it definitely works!I hope this helps! :)"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"so odd, it looked like it disappeared.","December 9, 2019",600 Rich,1,"I swatched on my hand as the pic show and it looked super dark for my complexion so I used it initially with caution.As I started to apply I noticed that there was no coverage at all!! it almost looked like it disappeared into my skin and nothing was there.I am pretty sure it was not my Beaty blender as I use it daily with various products and worked just fine in the past, and I use the same beauty blender every day.Oddly enough the product covered nothing and just literally disappeared onto my skin.This was the craziest thing ever"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Definitely an upgrade from what I've been using.,"November 23, 2020",,5,"I've been using that concealer that comes in a tube for, embarrassingly enough, decades. And I really haven't been that happy with it, especially now that I'm older and my skin is more affected by the pulling it causes. This is an excellent find for me!. It goes on very smoothly and I really don't need enough to do the area under my eyes, which is what I use it for most. Just a touch will do it because it spreads thinly while keeping its concealing attributes. I'm absolutely delighted and making the permanent switch to this product. My old concealer is in the trash. I'm moving on. Recommended!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Golden tan,"December 6, 2019",580 Tan,5,"Definitely a 5-star foundation! This is more of a liquid than my previous cream foundation and I like this so much better. It's smooth and will not cake in any fine lines or wrinkles. I tried ""Tan 580"" which I thought I'd be saving for summer use, but not so. To my surprise, it's a light tan when applied and really looks nice. Stay clear of your profile/jaw area and you won't need to worry about any tan lines! And although this is moisturizing, you should always use a light moisturizer before applying any foundation. As an avid-online shopper, I know how hard it is to purchase make-up without seeing an in-store color guide. So for reference, I'm Caucasian with porcelain light skin in the winter and I develop a light golden tan in the summer months. So don't think this tan foundation is just for medium or olive complexions - pale people will benefit too!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I'll stick with just foundation,"October 15, 2020",,3,"I've never really been much of a fan of concealer, I never really found that it covered much more than foundation. This really didn't seem any different to me than any others. To test it out, i had an ugly purple bruise on the inside of my arm. I put coat after coat, letting it dry in between, to see what kind of coverage it gave. Not much, and again, seemed just like foundation, but in a tiny bottle. I do suppose the moisturizing aspect of this product does make a better product for concealing pimples, if you are also using a product that would be drying to the skin to clear the blemish."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good talc-free pressed powder,"September 30, 2020",,5,"Really happy with the COVERGIRL Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder, 0.35 Ounce, 120 Fair (99350052603).  It's a neutral to slightly warm undertone and works well with my skin tone.  You can use it with the very nice sponge that comes with it or with a brush for a lighter dusting and it works nicely both ways. It is a little mattifying, but it's really a general pressed powder and not one that's specifically for people who struggle with shine.  I like the finish on my skin. Powder is very finely milled.Packaging is great and feels very secure and sturdy. I'm not at all worried about it accidentally opening or breaking in a purse."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for me...,"September 16, 2020",,1,"I use to always wear cover girl foundation but switched to neutrogena to help with blemishes. Mask wearing has caused me some breakouts and I'm also exhausted from work. I decided to try this concealer for under eyes and blemishes. I have to say I am unimpressed. To be fair perhaps I should have tried another shade but it didn't conceal anything. It creases under my eyes, it's hard to stop makeup from falling in those fine lines but this was worse then usual. After wearing it I just did some house work and when I looked in the mirror I looked more tired and my wrinkles were more pronounced. It also just didn't work at covering a blemish at all. Just layering my neutrogena skin clearing makeup does a better job."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Translucent is Great,"October 2, 2020",,5,"I love that Covergirl packaging never really changes over the years.  I got this powder because I needed a mattifying powder to pat my nose and cheeks with throughout the day.  It works great at instantly reducing the shine in those particular areas of my face.  It also lasts quite a while as well, several hours as a matter of fact so I like that it's the kind of product I don't really need to carry with me where ever I go since it lasts a long time.  But I still take it with me just in case.  I have tan skin and the translucent goes on a bit whitish at first but disappears once warmed up to my skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Feels lightweight.,"January 22, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,5,"I dislike the feeling of heavy makeup, and was pleased to find this is not heavy, at all. It covers smoothly, and you need only a small amount- start with less than you think you will need. The first few times I ended up wasting some because I needed less than I was used to with another brand. This does not feel greasy, and it seemed to stay put longer and not 'melt away'. It is doesn't give heavy coverage, but it gives enough to mask light flaws and discolorations easily. I like the variety of shades which should make it easy for anyone to find one that works best."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Keeps the shine away,"November 29, 2020",,4,"Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder, 160 Medium, 0.35 OzThe case is a bit difficult to open.  I prefer cases with a ""button"" in front to release the lid. I also don't like the color of the case. There's no separate compartment for the pad. Used pad rests directly on pressed powder. Not hygienic.The color is good.  It applies well, not chalky.My forehead is normally super shiny. You can see it from a mile away. This pressed powder is super effective at keeping the shine away. I do a few pats of this pressed powder on my forehead in the morning. The powder isn't obvious. By late afternoon, there's still no shine on my forehead."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good Coverage,"October 5, 2020",,4,"I like this concealer.  It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly.  It matches my skin tone well and ""hides my flaws""! I would say it has good coverage and since it's liquid, it is easy to apply.  It definitely lives up to its name - clean and fresh!  The only drawback I had was I wish it would last a little longer.  I guess it's impractical to think a concealer would last all day but by the end of the day, this one had pretty much worn off.  Maybe I didn't apply enough, who knows?!  I'm going to try applying more and see if that helps!  Overall though, I like it and recommend it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great Coverage,"January 26, 2020",580 Tan,4,This is a really good foundation for my skin. It has maximum coverage and moisturizes my face at the same time. There are also a lot of unique color choices to choose from. My usual foundation is a Covergirl brand as well so I guess sticking to the basics is the way to go. This one lasts as long as you need it to but it is also so easy to wash off. It doesn’t cause any skin irritations with my very sensitive skin and it’s very affordable.*If my review of this item is helpful please hit the helpful button below to let Amazon know. Thank you!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great Quality Brand for a great price,"December 3, 2019",510 Porcelain,4,I've been an avid Cover Girl user since I was a teenager.  I stopped using foundation awhile ago and switched to foundation powder instead.  I thought I would try this product to see if I missed the look of a foundation.  I thought this product was very smooth and light - didn't leave me feeling like I was wearing a heavy coating of foundation.  I liked it so much that I might change my mind and start wearing it daily with a loose powder.Worth giving it a try to see if it works for you.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Natural Shine-Stopping!,"September 20, 2020",,5,"This CoverGirl Clean Fresh pressed powder is effective. It comes in a sturdy compact that is durable and easy to carry. The powder is effective at stopping shine, yet the coverage is light and natural looking. It goes on smoothly with the swipe of the puff enclosed, evening out the skin tone. It is made with tapioca and Aloe Vera powder, natural ingredients, that help to cut back on oil in order to keep shine from returning throughout the day. It is light and can be layered for heavier coverage. Best of all, it is a healthy product to put on your skin. It contains no formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates, or talc. For this price, you cannot go wrong!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Hides dark circles under my eyes. Blends well.,"October 8, 2020",,4,"It was easy to blend in except it did make my skin sting a little. The color has helped me because I have been having a hard time sleeping this past week, and with not going out as much or getting normal amounts of sun anymore, the dark circles gave been more visible. This has helped mask that for Zoom conferences, so I still look fresh and alert. I'm bit sure how it would do if I was out and about all day like I was pre-Coronavirus, but for now it works for what I need for."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,nice!,"December 12, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"This goes on like a BB cream which I love. This color, light/medium works really nicely for me, I applied with my fingers. I'm originally a brunette, but have been a red head for many years. Medium tone, light eyes with freckles. I've been scanned by a contraption at sephora, which says I have pink/peach undertones(as opposed to yellow). My skin can be dry in the winter which is why I prefer liquid formulas. Never been a powder girl. This blended seamlessly. I wish it had SPF, then I'd definitely commit to getting it again. I like the ingredients as well, it's great that it's vegan and cruelty free and doesn't have parabens, talcs etc. I would say it's light-medium coverage, it almost covered up a few sunspots. The only thing I found weird is that is has an odd smell but overall I'm a fan!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Affordable and Effective,"September 20, 2020",,4,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   This is a nice little compact powder and would be very convenient for traveling.  It comes with a mirror inside and a small sponge.  The sponge has one side for applying powder, but the other side is more of a plastic/leather feel to grip onto.  Although the powder is white, it does apply translucent.  It does not have any scent.  I didn't love the application with the sponge, but it did apply nicely with a large powder brush.  I mainly use powder to matte my skin, and although this didn't work as well as some loose ones I have bought in a similar price range, it was still a good little product for the value."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Shocked that I really liked it this much!,"October 5, 2020",,4,I got the light and when I opened it I thought it looked too dark for me. I was outside on the porch when I opened it and applied it.It amazes me that it was not too dark.  It actually matched up to my skin tone and gave me enough cover to wear it alone without a foundation.I’ll be getting more when this is gone!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pressed Powder,"October 21, 2020",,3,"I used pressed powder makeup 20+ years ago but, as I needed more coverage switched to liquid makeup only. That being said, I decided to see whether ""pressed powder"" make up had changed or improved over the years.  IMO, if you have near perfect complexion, this might be all you need to stop the shine and look fresh. For me, it did not provide enough coverage with my imperfect skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Solid, quality concealer","April 2, 2021",,4,"This is a nice, light concealer for my 46 year old skin (normal skin). I like the coverage level - works great under my eyes and makes them look nice and light!  I love the feel of the concealer - feather light and easy to apply. A little goes a long way, so start light. On acne it works well. Longevity is the only issue - it doesn't quite last the whole day, but I've battled with that issue for a while. I haven't found a light-weight one that lasts 8 hours. If you want long lasting it needs to be thick. So with that in mind - give this a try. Nice product, great value."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,lightweight and blendable,"July 30, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,5,"Here's my stats: I'm a daily makeup wearer,  very oily skin, wear 420 or 440 in Fenty foundation. Normally I get darker over the summer but thanks to the current pandemic I'm not getting much sun. I was surprised to like this foundation. It's really lightweight- I consider it more of a colored moisturizer or BB cream which is perfect for summer. I tend to prefer matte formulas because I'm very oily but this product didn't have me looking like a grease ball at 5PM. As you can see from my picture the color isn't an exact match but because it's so lightweight it blends very well. It didn't transfer onto my mask or clothes which is a plus. I give it two thumbs up!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very lightweight,"November 25, 2020",,3,"I guess I just need more from my concealer, because I couldn't get enough concealer from this concealer no matter how many layers I applied. The consistency is creamy, but thin. It feels nice and lightweight, and it didn't brighten my under eyes a little. But it seemed to mostly just soak into my skin and look like I needed to apply it again. It did stay put pretty well through the day without settling into creases. If you need just a slight amount of coverage or brightening, this might be perfect for you."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very nice texture - sheer lightweight moisturizing a bit more than all my others,"July 21, 2020",600 Rich,5,"I love this I am surprised that I am able to get this to blend into my skin, regardless of the fact that it is a bit dark for me.  I'd love to see how a lighter shade will look. More dewy is suspect.I am able to blend concealer over dark spots, and cover it with this.There is not too much in the tube, yet that is a plus for me - I can spend less at one time, and reorder - a fresh one after use.Covergirl makeup has transitioned over the years from pinkish menthol-scented clean makeup, to more realistic looking goodness.  I love it!There are some awesome ingredients for this price - this is a great experience. Love it!  Enjoy!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Light, fragrance-free foundation and no SPF protection","December 31, 2019",530 Fair/Light,4,This is a very light foundation that has no SPF. It is easy to apply with a dime-sized dollop that will cover the entire face especially if blended with a moistened sponge. It provides minimal coverage but does even out skin tone and diminishes small blemishes. My skin is very fair and prone to sensitivity and this caused no reaction and had no tendency to create skin issues. The color was perfect for my skin tone and I liked the look of it on my face. I always set with powder and use a primer first and noticed no caking as it went on very easily.I've worn Covergirl products for years and will continue to do so. I only wish this had some sun protection but I do like it and will definitely use it.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"I like that I can use it on a ""no makeup"" day just to even out my Lupus red butterfly rash","December 13, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"I have Lupus as well as other health issues, but the Lupus is the one disease that shows itself front and center in the form of a butterfly shaped rash on my cheeks and nose. There are MANY days where I don't feel like doing up my makeup but I do like to at least put moisturizer on. What I like about this formula is that it goes on lightly, but you can also add layers to build coverage. But with just one application I am able to cover up the shock of red, to where it still looks like I have no makeup on. Because nobody wants to walk around looking like they got hit by the foundation makeup bus - especially if the rest of the face isn't sporting any other makeup!  It's like an all in one makeup/foundation that is similar to a BB cream!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not my favorite,"September 26, 2020",,3,I don't feel like I get much coverage from this concealer and it is on the thinner side.  I also don't really like the applicator.  The applicator feels kind of rough and stiff and I have to repeatedly dip it back into the tube to get enough product.  I didn't notice this concealer caking up and it didn't irritate my eyes at all.  Another positive is that this concealer blends well.  I just can't give it 5 stars because of it being thin and light coverage.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Nice, light coverage","December 31, 2019",520 Fair,4,"I suspect this product is aimed at women much younger than I am (50s), but I am lucky enough to have good skin and hate the feeling of heavy foundation, so I thought I would give this a try. I like that the foundation goes on smoothly, and the amount of coverage is what I expected (I did not try to build it up, but the tube says that it is buildable coverage). I wouldn't describe the coverage as ""dewy,"" but it looks nice, and it is moisturizing. I always wear one of the first two shades of any foundation line, and the ""fair"" color works fine for me. The one thing I did not like was the smell, which I would describe as an odd cross between medicinal and perfumey. It did not linger, though, and I only noticed it during application."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Milky & Smooth,"July 23, 2020",630 Deep/Dark,5,"I would definitely define my skin tone as ""deep"" & ""dark"", so the 630 Deep Dark was literally perfect for me. I'm always nervous getting makeup online because you can't test, but I did my research and this one matched. For me, this foundation is much milkier than other brands I've used. Which is good for a small amount having a lot of coverage. It blended well and my powder dried it nicely to give it a matte finish. (I haven't had any issues with particles like some others...)"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good coverage, lightweight","January 5, 2020",530 Fair/Light,5,"I haven't used a cream foundation for several years. Instead, I've used a higher-end powder foundation, but when the formula for it changed recently, I wasn't as happy with it. Hence, giving this Covergirl foundation a try. Turns out, I really like this foundation. It's light and doesn't take much to cover, but it provides really good coverage. It has a silky feel to it and a clean scent, which is a big plus in my book. I've been using this foundation for about 3 weeks steady, and there's still plenty left in the tube, so like I said, a little goes a long way. It's so light that I didn't really feel like I was wearing anything, and given the great coverage, I'd say this is an excellent value for the money."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Works so well for me---!,"December 14, 2020",,5,"I am very happy with Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder. I chose medium tan and the color matches me perfectly. It is not messy, and holds for the time I need. I do have oily skin and this power so helps in controlling this problem..This powder is pretty much scent free which is nice compared to some powders I have used and it really does not seem to rub off under normal conditions.  Although it can be used with a brush I find I get a much better application with the little spongy applicator---I am very very happy with this item---thank you!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Blends good, Conceals well under foundation.","October 4, 2020",,4,"This comes in a clear plastic tube with an applicator wand. It goes on thick and blends well.  I usually use ivory foundation and found that this fair colored concealer works good to hide blemishes and not make it too obvious that I'm using concealer.It isn't as thick or have as much coverage as other concealers out there but for the price this works very well.To me I wouldn't say it moisturized, i feel like it made my skin look a little drier in the spots where I used this, before I added foundation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Buildable, doesn't crack, last through the day, dries one shade lighter","January 30, 2021",,4,"My girlfriend's impressions:1. This is a buildable concealer.2. Covers very well.3. Looks quite natural, but doesn't really provide a dewy finish.4. I feel it dries one shade lighter than listed. Perhaps that's because of my skin tone.5. This does not crack at all, even when really built up.6. Not watery.7. Dries fast.Overall, this is a good concealer.4 starsCheers!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great Coverage!,"December 25, 2019",530 Fair/Light,4,"This foundation went on very smoothly and covered my skin imperfections well without drying them out.  It blended very easily, and I liked the finished product, but it claims that it gives a dewy finish.  I would say that it was more of a normal skin finish.  It stayed on all day and didn’t dry my skin out at all.I received the light/medium, and it was the perfect shade for me, even though I normally choose a lighter shade - it was easy to blend in and get the lighter shade that I wanted.  I can imagine that in the summer when I’ve gotten some sun on my face, that applying this a little more denser would result in good coverage and color too.  I liked the flexibility that the light/medium coverage provided."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Tiny balls left behind,"December 4, 2019",520 Fair,4,"I like nearly everything about this except I noticed tiny balls left behind. I'm not sure what this is about or if it's just something weird with the bottle I recieved but I figures I would put it out there anyway. This feels really nice on your skin and goes on really smooth. It has a dewy finish and gives my skin a healthy youthful appearance. I love that this contains no formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates, or talc! It's formulated for all skin types and had a very lightweight sheer coverage. I used a primer the second time for more coverage and it worked out good and wasn't cakey. It really blurs imperfections without clogging pores or looking too made up. All in all, the benefits are great and I will use it again in the future for sure!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Don’t Judge a Book By Its Covergirl,"December 4, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"I often wear powder foundation, but often in the winter when my skin gets drier, I like to rotate in a liquid foundation.  It makes my skin look a bit younger and fresher.  This is a nice choice for that.This goes on as heavy or light as you want it - that buildable quality.  It seems to wear fairly well also, although I have no idea it would bear up in the heat of the summer.It has very little fragrance and absorbs well.  I have found that especially when I use a primer, I absolutely need a setting powder after.I have no idea about the chemistry involved, although it claims to be lacking a lot of nasty stuff.  Overall, this is a nice product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Easy Application, Natural Look","January 1, 2020",560 Medium,4,"I like this foundation for its easy application and for its lightweight feel that evens out my skin and looks natural. I applied with a damp sponge over moisturizer and primer. It gave me even light to medium coverage with a natural finish. The packaging says dewy finish, but I disagree. It has a slight sheen on my dry skin, but not what I would call dewy. I used shade 550 and I think ""light/medium"" is a reasonable description. I have a light complexion and usually can wear foundations a little darker than the ""fair"" shades. 550 has a slight yellow undertone on me. It doesn't gather in my fine lines and still looks good to me after 9-10 hours of wear. I would recommend to those with dryer skin wanting a little coverage and a natural finish."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Never Makes Me Break Out,"November 7, 2020",,5,"I always like this kind of face powder because it does not make me break out and helps to a certain amount to control oil and shine. Definitely don't use much makeup now because of Covid-19 and wearing masks (what's the point?) but whenever this is over, I will be using this on a daily basis like I did prior to this virus situation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,great at showing off imperfections!!,"December 5, 2019",510 Porcelain,3,"don’t like, it is not older dry skin friendly one bit nor friendly for large pores areas.after it started to dry on skin it showed off every tiny piece of dry skin i didn’t even see with my own eyes beforehand and instead of going over imperfect areas like large pores on nose area, it soaked into them and show them off as being even larger looking!! this is also not rosacea redness friendly, it did nothing to help tame the redness look down some at all.overall, i think this is more for young folks with semi perfect skin that is also not on the dry flaky side. could i suppose work for older skin that are on normal to oily too but, i would get a shade higher than your skin otherwise its worthless."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Perfect Your Zoom Look!,"September 27, 2020",,5,"This super cute compact is great for quick touch-ups throughout the day! I have been using this in-between long Zoom meetings just to touch up my make-up to perfection.This powder preserves the color of your foundation: it does not accidentally lighten or darken it. Likewise, it quickly absorbs any oil ... leaving a really beautiful matte look.It has no discernable scent. And it even comes with a little sponge/poof that fits inside the compact (it's really ideal).Everything here is pretty perfect. And the outstanding price is just a wonderful bonus! Highly recommended!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Didn’t Settle or Streak,"September 27, 2020",,5,"This concealer met my needs. While I’m pretty much a makeup minimalist, I still like blurring out the dark circles that naturally occur under my eyes. I’m very fair. Any whiff of discoloration is amplified. So I dapped a few dots of this concealer under my eyes and gently massaged it in with my fingertip. Blends well with naked or made-up skin does hydrate (or rather it doesn’t dry out), good subtle coverage, realistically lasts most of the day. The fair light matched my skin tone well. I have mature skin. Thankfully, this concealer also didn’t settle, crease, or streak around my eyes."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Weightless Powder,"September 30, 2020",,5,"I really like this translucent powder! Once I finish applying my foundation and concealer, I typically finish it off with a setting powder. This one looks like a white powder at first and gives the white case look upon application but once it's brushed off and set, the white cast is gone. It keeps the oil away for a long period of time and it's weightless on."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Flawless look,"January 22, 2021",,5,I was very impressed with these foundation powder. I used it on top of my liquid foundation and it really just made it look flawless and Matte.I included a photo of how my face looked after I put the powder on my face! It just evened out the color and made my face look very smooth!The package is very nice and clean. It comes with a nice mirror and a sponge applicator. I usually just use my powder brush though.The color might be a little too dark for me but it still works!!I would definitely recommend this product!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Feels wonderful,"December 28, 2019",540 Light,4,"The Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk is a wonderful product. It is more liquidy than other foundations, but when applied it goes on smoothly and evenly. And since it is more liquidy, a little goes a long way. It feels great when applied - more like putting on moisturizer than a foundation. It is very light feeling. It is also long-lasting. My only reason for deducting a star is that it is lacking any SPF. As someone with skin cancer issues, this is super important to me. I can always apply a moisturizer with SPF before I apply this Skin Milk, but I would much rather have it as a 2 in 1 product. With that being said, I will wear it everyday (with SPF) because I like the feel and look of it on my skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Has grit in it like a face scrub !?!,"December 7, 2019",580 Tan,1,"This stuff is really bad.  each time I try to use it, several bits of grit come out with each squeeze... not sure why it has that, maybe it is contaminated stock?  The product smells like coconut and sits on the skin versus absorbing.  The color, tan, goes on light and with no real coverage.  I have olive skin that is fair this time of year; normally, when I am tan I wear tan, and this is way too light while I am not tanned!  Just bad all around; and, it accomplishes nothing... going bare face or with powder is better."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Ok as a backup,"September 29, 2020",,3,"Written by my wife: I usually prefer a stick concealer, but thought I would try this liquid one because I use other CoverGirl products and like them. Using this one, I can see that it’s just what I was afraid it would be...hard to blend because it feels like I’m just wiping it off, and it settles in creases. I usually wear a “fair” color in other concealers, but this one is a bit too orangey for my skin tone, and I don’t feel that it truly covered my dark under eye circle. (In my photo I have the concealer on the left side) I think I’ll stay with my stick and just keep this for an emergency backup."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Works really well on my dark circles - but not on my whole face.,"October 10, 2020",,4,"I've tried so many products on my mature crepey skin, and all the liquids make the lines and dry areas show way more.  So I tried this and one quick swipe under my eyes and the dark color is reduced 80% and my skin doesn't look worse.  I do have to make sure I'm well moisturized prior to use or any dry flaky skin really shows.  But of all the products I've tired this - for me - is the best.  I do have a hard time getting it open to use, a little larger tab would help with that."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Excellent coverage and lasts all day long,"December 11, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,Having experienced damaged and dry skin from excessive sun exposure gave me a wake up call. This Covergirl moisturizes and provides an even tone without feeling thick or heavy.ProsEasy to use squeeze containerFoundation goes on smooth and evenlyEven coverage without appearing overly appliedResults are smooth skin and blemish freeConsThe only concern I have is that this Covergirl has a slight chemical smell that dissipates over time
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very good coverage; surprisingly a good option for pale girls,"November 16, 2020",,5,"This is a surprisingly good concealer. I am extremely light (my only real foundation match is between a Light 40 and Light 41 Neutral in Kat Von D Lock-It foundation -- and I am a true neutral, with almost blue-grey undertones if anything). This is almost as light as my natural skintone; it isn't perfect, but it's very close to it.It's pretty good in terms of coverage; it's better for broader areas of skin than for blemish coverage, however.All in all, very good. Surprisingly so."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great size and nice to have!,"October 20, 2020",,5,"This is a great sized product, will last a while as long as you use it properly and don't go overboard. It is great if you are prone to oily skin or in the summer if you will be sweating. Perfect to throw in your purse if you want to bring it with you for touchups throughout the day!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light coverage,"December 5, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,The CoverGirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk is a very light foundation that feels somewhere between a BB cream and a traditional foundation. It goes on smoothly and blends in well with my fingers. It gives moderate coverage of dark spots and blemishes but does even my overall skin tone. It does have a dewy finish that feels fresh and not at all thick and cakey. My skin does feel soft and smooth and more natural. The light/medium color matched my skin tone well and I will use it for regular day wear.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very light and smooth!,"December 4, 2019",580 Tan,5,This went on my skin very smoothly even when just using my finger when in a pinch.  It also blended in with my natural skin tone very well.  I don’t normally use any foundation or concealer so this was very new user friendly.  It did not get dry or start crusting at all even after a full day of Black Friday shopping. I have dry (cheeks) and oily (forehead & nose) skin.  It did not cause any irritation nor was uncomfortable at any point.  I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend this.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good Coverage But Makes My Eyes Water,"January 27, 2021",,3,"I really wanted to like this concealer because it covers my ""black and blue"" under eye shadows so well.  I tried it with my regular makeup that doesn't irritate my eyes and every time I wore this, my eyes watered.  If you have sensitive eyes, you may want to think twice about this.  I deducted two stars because though the coverage is great, I can't use it safely.I hope this gives you some information to make the decision that is right for you."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Thick concealer,"December 17, 2020",,5,"This concealer is nice and smooth and the perfect amount of thickness. I usually use the wet n wild concealer and I like this consistency more. I originally got it to use as a bronzer to contour but once it arrived it was lighter than the pictures and only about 1-2 shades darker than me so I will not really be able to use it as a stand alone bronzer but I do like how it goes on. Buying online can be tricky, I'd like them to add pictures of different skin tone arm swatches for better reference."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It is an Okay product,"December 30, 2020",,4,"This covergirl clean fresh hydrating concealer is very easy to apply , has a good feel to it and pretty much lightweight. It was not the closest to my skin tone, but that is one of the drawback of ordering online. I normally use a different brand and would normally know what to order, but I wanted to give this one a try.I feel like the quality can be improved a little , but it really is not that bad for the price"

I added blended it in with my foundation and was happy with the result. It conceals the dark places under my eyes really well.I did notice a little dewy look when I finished applying my make-up. I can't say that the dewy look made a big difference but it was enough for me. It blends very easily too. I have used some that don't blend as well as this one does.I will be recommending COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer to my friends and family.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good stuff - 600 rich,"June 16, 2020",600 Rich,5,This foundation is lightweight and perfect for any skin complexion. Goes on smooth and last throughout my workday. This is a great base for my regular make up routine. I also tried using this product over the weekend just to make my natural skin pop and just pair it with a little lip glass. Perfect for that natural subtle look. This is my first time trying covergirl products and I am very pleased with it. Will not only be adding this foundation to my make up kit but will now explore what other products they have to offer.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good setting powder but light coverage,"September 30, 2020",,4,"I typically only use concealer and powder on my face so I'm used to a full coverage powder. This is very light coverage compared to what I'm used to but I keep finding myself reaching for it in the morning. I typically put a light coat over my other powder with this, similar to a setting powder, to keep my face matte just a little longer.Overall, I really like this...I'm just not sure that I'll wear it alone as it's intended. It's a bit too light coverage for me."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight,"August 29, 2020",620 Deep,4,"Very lightweight feeling as well as light coverage. It gave my skin a “cool” effect once applied and I barely felt that it was on. I can’t attest to how well it builds because I only tried it by itself. I think I got one shade too dark though, it gave me a tanned look (it doesn’t show that well in the picture). I think the rich/deep would’ve matched my tone more than the one I got, which was deep."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Caused milia, quit using after a week","December 16, 2019",530 Fair/Light,3,"This stuff is lightweight and has decent coverage but after a few days I developed milia, which is a rash, along my chin. This happened once before with another lotion. I quit using it and after a few days, it went away. Up until that point, I was able to use it for about a week. It felt like I wasn't wearing anything, which was nice, but it also didn't last. It's very light coverage, meaning it won't hide much in the line of blemishes or imperfections. I don't wear much makeup anyway so that's not a huge deal for me, but could be for someone else. I didn't feel it moisturized any better than any other lotion I've ever used and since it caused milia, I won't be using it again."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice Color!,"December 11, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"This skin milk reminds me a lot of BB Cream. It's lighter than traditional foundation and very moisturizing. It does have a scent to it which I can't place. It reminds me of almond milk, but different. (I know that's vague, but it's the best I can do!). I've used it several times so far. 4 out of 5 times it looked great. The fifth time, it was cakey and I ended up removing it and reapplying. I'm in my early 50's and realize that the issues I have with my aging skin may not be the targeted audience. Before I apply it, I put on serum and moisturizer and sometimes a primer. The color is nice on me. I would definitely consider reordering this."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great For Fair Skin!,"November 13, 2020",,5,"I have very fair skin and have a hard time finding foundations that aren't too orange but also aren't so light they make me look like a ghost. This foundation goes on light but has buildable coverage and doesn't oxidize orange or look too pale.  I ordered the color ""fair"" and it think it matches pretty well. I also have very sensitive skin and it hasn't made me break out so its a yes in my book!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Weird formulation,"May 14, 2020",530 Fair/Light,4,"I’ve been trying to find a light coverage foundation or tinted moisturizer that blended into my skin and I finally found it!! This is so great but I did notice that when I use this product with a primer, it balls up all over my face, so much so that I had to take it off. I hadn’t noticed this the first time I used this foundation because I only swatched it on my cheek for a couple hours (and it held up really well btw). Today I decided to give it a try while I was messing around with my makeup and I forgot to put primer on and it didn’t ball up! It blends flawlessly into my skin and has lasted all day so far, I even went on a jog and it stayed on! I gave it 4 stars bc idk why it balls up with a primer and it’s kind of annoying that it does, but everything else about this foundation is amazingggggg!!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Better applied with a brush,"September 22, 2020",,4,I have tried so many powders that turn me into flashback mary and this one isn't too bad. The consistency is a little old fashioned powdery but I found applying it with a brush worked out far better. I would simply skip the puff included and use this for at home. The compact is nice and very feminine feeling but unless you carry a brush I would keep it at home. It feels almost like the Kim K brightening powder and it certainly does brighten. I got mine in translucent. I would definitely recommend for the under eye/t zone area for brightening.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Feels nice,"November 3, 2020",,5,"I am not a big make up person. I wear CG BB Cream, concealer and maybe some powder. This pairs well with the BB cream I am already using. It is smooth and blends in well unlike some others that I have tried that drag on your face and sit heavy. I have dark sun spots and occasional circles under my eyes. This covers the sun spots a bit but does not nearly have enough coverage to mask them completely. It does though help even out some of the lighter, uneven areas on my face. And also, helps with the eye circles."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Moisturizing and works well,"September 20, 2020",,5,"I have dry skin which is sometimes an issue with some concealers as well as foundations, however, this went on nicely and didn't cause me any weird issues, like moving around or making my dry skin look worse. It did seem to be moisturizing so I'd recommend it to other people with normal to dry skin. It also covered some of my redness which happens around my nose or cheeks sometimes."

My cheeks can look especially rosy during the winter, but not in a pleasant way.  This foundation didn't quite cover it up, but is really nice, light, and not drying at all.  I hate when a light foundation goes on silky but ends up dry.  If using this on patchy, pigmented skin, you might need some other coverup or base to go with it.  Otherwise, it is light and works as a nice foundation."

This product is formulated without Talc, Parabens, Formaldehyde, Phthalates, Mineral Oil, Sulfates and Fragrance.This foundation is high quality and non toxic! I highly recommend this product!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,A good basic.,"October 16, 2020",,4,"I ordered the translucent-  I like using this  to lightly ‘dust’ over the t-zone after after applying foundation... it helps it to stay in place a little longer, especially in the humid summertime.  The translucent is a TRUE translucent (some go on looking like white powder 🥴) but this one completely disappears.  I prefer applying with a big fluffy powder brush.  I think the only thing I’d change is the fact that the compact itself is a little ‘chunky’ so if you carry it in a smaller bag/purse it takes up a good bit of room."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light & Blends Well,"August 27, 2020",620 Deep,5,"My Wife thought this was a really good choice for a foundation. Very light, she said it doesn't feel ""cakey"" on her face like some of the cheaper foundations. Easy for her to blend, offers good coverage. What she seemed to like most is that it actually stayed on all day, even with the heat. We live in the Gulf South, so she has to plan her makeup accordingly, considering how hot and humid it is here. She said that she had no problems with wearing it all day, so she's recommend it to anyone who lives in a hot and humid climate."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for me.,"February 28, 2021",,2,"I haven’t used pressed powder in years, but when I did I always went with covergirl so this seemed like the best option. I did not like this at all. It left my skin very uneven and blotchy looking and it just kind of sat on top without blending in. I have fairly normal skin with just a few dry spots in the nose area and this left my whole face dry. Would not purchase again."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"A super moisturizing, lightweight formula...","December 16, 2019",550 Light/Medium,5,"It is daunting trying to match foundation on the internet, but this was not the case for the Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk foundation. The Light/Medium shade sinks into the skin like a moisturizer but with a tint. I have very fair skin with a red undertone, and it worked perfectly for me. It does have that distinctive Covergirl scent and is between fresh and medicinal. However, this scent dissipates quickly. This formula is very lightweight and give a natural glow to the skin.  I love using this formula for days when I need makeup but only a light look. Highly recommend!!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Very moisturizing, applies smoothly, blends in well","October 2, 2020",,5,"This review is for the COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer.  This is my wife’s favorite concealer, and one that she uses everyday.  It’s very moisturizing and not dry at all.  Other concealers can tend to be too dry and look unnatural, while this one does not have that problem at all. She really likes the way it applies smoothly, and then evens out without stretching the eye tissue.  It provides excellent cover up, blending in well with the surrounding skin.Excellent product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covers amazingly smooth and easy--soft and lightly scented,"October 2, 2020",,5,"COVERGIRL Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder, 0.35 Ounce, 120 Fair (99350052603)Wow, this pressed powder goes on feather light and even and covers beautifully. I had applied some blush prior to applying and this powder covered it. Description says it evens skin tone--and it does! I applied a light second layer under my eyes--and it builds in effortlessly without looking over-applied. Not the kind of puff I normally use but will get used to it. I ""freshened"" the powder just slightly after working outside."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,My friend is back!,"September 25, 2020",,5,"Wow, I wonder why I stopped using this powder?  I feel like I have found a long lost friend who is just better than when I last saw her!This powder is just awesome!  Unlike back in the 90's where the powder felt heavy, this powder just glides over my skin and gives me the high end finish I really need!Awesome product I am so glad to use Covergirl again!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very lightweight foundation.,"January 1, 2020",510 Porcelain,4,"I'm a redhead with very very light skin, the porcelain shade was perfect for me. I'm also pretty acne prone with a fair amount of redness. This foundation is a very lightweight foundation that was both moisturizing and helped tone down my redness a little. I can tell it's buildable to an extent, but it's not for anyone who wants heavy coverage. This foundation is for people who don't want to wear much makeup, but want to look refreshed and awake. I've had no skin reactions to this foundation, despite my acne, and I will probably use this for my day to day foundation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Get that dewy look!,"December 9, 2019",510 Porcelain,5,"I've been chasing that dewy look for years, and it's finally here. This almost seems like a moisturizer, it goes on so creamy and blends in so nicely. It has a dewy, but not greasy look and feel. It stays on for a long work day, doesn't cake up around  my eyes or mouth. Will be getting more when this runs out!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It applies smoothly with a good coverage,"December 13, 2019",510 Porcelain,4,"I like the way my skin feels while wearing this Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk foundation, because while it applies smoothly, it also dries very fast, leaving my skin with a flawless look. It has a good coverage, I applied without any concealer to see how much would cover some of the skin imperfections I have, and I'm pleased to say that it covered most of them. And if one wants a flawless  complexion, all one must do is to apply one layer of this foundation, and wait until is dry to apply a second. The later is a good idea to do on special occasions. I also like that it is easy to carry in a makeup bag."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Awesome concealer,"April 4, 2021",,5,I got this for my wife as she wanted to try this brand. She said this was a perfect shade for her. It worked well and covers all the dark spots underneath her eyes. It glides very well onto the skin no lumps or anything. It was very long-lasting and no itchiness. She would buy more after she finishes with this bottle. Overall she recommends this concealer.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,This COVERGIRL clean fresh skin milk medium is like a Combo moisturizer/foundation.,"February 13, 2020",560 Medium,5,"This COVERGIRL clean fresh skin milk medium is like a Combo moisturizer/foundation. This could almost be used like an instant tan it glides on so easy and covers so well. A little goes a long way. It instantly tints the skin looking natural. When it dries it doesn't crack at all. It doesn't cake or look powdery.  It is just the right amount of tint to cover any blemishes and smooth my skin out.  Even if I do not wear any other make up, this makes me look and feel great.  The packaging is nice and it is simply the best.  Wish I had more than 1 ounce!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great coverage!,"October 30, 2020",,5,"Cover girl clean fresh concealer I am impressed! I have been using this and even had my daughter try it I am 36 and conceal under my eyes for brightening and any flaws, my daughter is 15 and has young beautiful skin but we both love this concealer! It conceals! It blends perfectly! Fully covers without being heavy! I definitely recommend. See photos"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Lightweight tinted moisturizer, perfect for face in the summer","May 4, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,5,"I really appreciate when companies concentrate on making products with natural ingredients.  This product is 100% Vegan and does NOT contain any Formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates or talc.It goes on very light and is perfect for summer wear.  It works great on my sensitive skin.  I really like knowing that is is also a moisturizer that nourishes my skin throughout the day. It's very nice knowing that it contains coconut milk and Aloe extract.And better yet, it comes in 14 different shades."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Makeup for the person who doesn't like wearing makeup!,"May 3, 2020",620 Deep,5,"I wear lipstick and eyeliner with a swipe of eyeshadow and tend to shy away from foundation because I don't like how it feels on my skin. Even usually 'lightweight' ones feel uncomfortable.  Covergirl's Skin milk didn't feel like anything was on my skin, which I loved! My acne scars still show however it did a great job smoothing out my complexion. I have hyperpigmentation, so I would need concealer however for the type of makeup wearer that I am, it's perfect."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Love it,"October 14, 2020",,5,This is a fantastic product. I’m honestly so so happy to have discovered this. I found the coverage of this concealer to be perfect for under my eyes. It was very moisturizing and yet didn’t move around on my face. It also didn’t settle into the lines under my eyes. It was subtle and made me look great. This shade was perfect for my NC 15-20 skin.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,LOVE this foundation ~,"December 19, 2019",510 Porcelain,5,"I love this Covergirl, Clean Fresh Skin Milk Porcelain foundation ~ it goes on smooth and silky, and the color matches my winter skin perfectly.  I have been using much more expensive cover up, but my winter pallor was making it look too dark so I thought I'd give this a shot, and my skin actually looks and feels BETTER than it did using more expensive cover up.  This just goes on so clean, silky smooth and looks fantastic."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Loved this one,"October 1, 2020",,5,"The scent was pleasant. But I was super surprised that it matched my skin tone and never caked on my skin. Which is naturally dry. It went on evenly and was buildable. The packaging was actually really nice and the compact mirror is very clear, not distorted like some. Even the applicator was very soft and did a great job distributing product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good coverage over minor blemishes.,"October 25, 2020",,4,This concealer gave me great coverage all day in some problem areas. Just make sure your skin is hydrated. I had some peeling from sunburn and it kinda caked around it so I had to wet a blender brush and really thin it out and work it in. I love the size of this tube and applicator because I can throw it in my purse and take it with me on the go. I don’t wear a full face but I do like to cover problem sections when they arise.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Cruelty-Free Vegan Facial Powder Foundation,"January 19, 2021",,5,"My wife wanted a cruelty-free vegan facial powder with no formaldehyde, parabens, or sulfates, so she got Covergirl Facial Powder. The powder works well, it absorbs oils, reduces unsightly skin shine from excess oil, and gives a natural complexion. If you're looking for an everyday facial powder with non-irritating additives and is cruelty-free and you're looking for natural effects of a non-shining powder, my wife can give this a strong recommendation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,loving this stuff,"October 9, 2020",,5,"This one is a bit more yellow shade than my color. Which actually works really well for under eyes. It doesn't completely remove my dark circles that seem to never go away, but it certainly looks a lot before.It also doesn't clog my pores like some concealers.I love to put this on just for my no makeup days. It looks natural when I use my blender, and it makes me feel a bit more refreshed."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Nice, low foundation","December 14, 2019",550 Light/Medium,5,"I have fair skin and got the light/medium type. Usually, foundation doesn't really blend well on my face and stands out, but this goes on really smooth. I love the moisturizer that's within the foundation because it really helps to go on smoothly. Bottle is a bit small, but I don't usually need a lot to cover spots here and there on my face. Love that it's a vegan foundation and no parabens. Cruelty-free too! I highly recommend for anyone who doesn't use a lot of foundation, but just wants something that highs a few flaws and red patches."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Most satisfied,"December 18, 2020",,5,"My skin doesn't need a liquid base. This Cover Girl tan powder is just right for my complexion, as it lightens dark patches, reduces greatly any shininess, tones down the pinkish tint that a sub-tropical sun gives me and of greatest importance, the end result is an overall consistent color.I would've liked if it had a slight scent, but that's trivial.The compact is nice and in general I'm very happy with how it looks on me."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very light coverage,"December 20, 2019",560 Medium,4,"This ""skin milk"" gives super light coverage for a natural look that is just a bit more polished than nothing.I normally wear a light base color, but I like this ""Medium"" color quite a lot because I can wear this alone or layer it over my normal base to add a bit of ""been in the sun"" color without it looking fake or creating any lines where the darker color ends.The texture is quite liquid so it goes on smoothly and is very easily blended in.Although I'm still not exactly sure what ""skin milk"" means, I do like this product quite a lot."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight,"October 11, 2020",,4,"The concealer comes with a nice applicator brush and you can rub it in with a beauty blender or your finger. It’s silky smooth textures feels in wrinkles older your eye and doesn’t make small wrinkles visible. It does not cake. The light medium color I ordered blends well under your eye without making it look too white, it is more of a natural tone. For different skin tones I would recommend getting something a little lighter than your foundation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Amazing Concealer,"October 10, 2020",,5,"This is my first time using clean makeup and I love it!  I like the consistency it has the right thickness, it's very lightweight and buildable.  This formula worked well with my foundation also longwear.  It gives a natural and hydrated look.  It's not fast drying, you have time to blend in and if you need another layer let it dry first then apply more concealer.  This was a good match for me."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Looks natural! Wife loves it!,"October 3, 2020",,5,"My wife loves this Clean Fresh pressed powder by CoverGirl. It’s very natural and clean looking. It comes with an application sponge, however my wife prefers using a makeup brush instead.What’s great is that it absorbs the oil, to keep your face looking fresh and clean! It also doesn’t contain phthalates, mineral oil, formaldehyde, talc, parabens, or sulfates... which is great!! 👍"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Light feeling, matte finish makeup, but with paint-like scent","December 16, 2019",600 Rich,3,"The color of this was a bit dark for me currently, although it might be good in summer with a darker ran. The product when tested on back or my hand felt like it went on smooth and light. It dried with a matte finish.It had an odd smell that reminded me of some kind of paint we used to use in art class as a kid.  I don't like much scent in my cosmetics, especially since my skin is sensitive, and the smell of this one made me feel like I was painting my skin with a craft paint.  My hand didn't react to this cosmetic, but not sure how my face would handle it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Decent,"September 29, 2020",,4,This is a gentle non- irritating concealor. The light shade was a tad warm  for my skin but that was unnoticeable under foundation and a dusting of translucent powder. The doe foot sponge applicator is easy to use. It does a decent job of hiding dark spots and blemishes. It does fade but still provides some coverage. More effective on flat marks than raised.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Shade is perfect for my skin tone - product doesn't blend very well - takes practice,"December 5, 2019",530 Fair/Light,4,"This one ounce squeeze style container of foundation came in the right shade.  530 Fair Light matches my skin tone perfectly.  But during and after application, I see streaks.  Make sure you blend this completely before applying setting powder.I will use this foundation, as it feels like as a feather on my face, but its really not blending well.  I do like the shade, and container."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl sure has come a long way...Works well for mature skin too,"December 5, 2019",520 Fair,5,"I haven’t used Covergirl makeup in years, and I’m really impressed. This skin milk formula is so light and sheer, but provides adequate coverage, and leaves your skin looking fresh. I have a fair complexion, and thought the fair shade was too light at first, but it blended in perfectly.It’s fragrance free, there’s no orange tones, it doesn’t leave you looking powdery, dull and dry, and it retains its finish throughout the day. Having older skin, it minimized the look of fine lines and feels good. I’m really liking it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covers and blends well without caking in wrinkles,"October 1, 2020",,5,"I am very pleased with this concealer. A little bit covers well, blends in, and doesn’t cake in wrinkles. The sponge tip brush is a great applicator. It’s difficult, though, to choose colors online. I wish I had gotten one shade darker.COVERGIRL makes great concealers. I have also used their stick concealer. I consider them a low end makeup brand, but their concealers are top notch. I highly recommend this “Clean Fresh Concealer.”"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice powder.,"September 23, 2020",,5,"I had no idea what to expect from a translucent powder as I have never used one before.I did my makeup and then I “poofed” the translucent powder over it to “set” it. I like what it did. It made it feel like it would last longer throughout the day.It doesn’t have much of a scent to it as some powders do. It’s very light, almost non existent.This product is exactly as advertised. I’m having fun using it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Great value for ""basic"" make-up look","October 2, 2020",,4,"Most of the Cover Girl makeup is of decent quality for someone who just does basic make-up such as myself. This was no exception. It went on smoothly and covered quite well.  Excellent value. Coverage was light to medium. Your typical mirror compact with a foam applicator (which I never use, as I prefer a brush).  Another good value product from Cover Girl."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Perfect natural look,"December 3, 2019",560 Medium,5,"This is so light! I loooove it! Color match perfectly, very nice texture, but here is the best part about it: my skin literally slacked it up and I got perfect natural finish, doesn’t look like I have pound of foundation on. This days natural looks are really the way to go, so this foundation will hide what needs to be hidden but wouldn’t look like you have a heavy make up on. For the price it’s a find! I’m very surprised with how well this works! Excited to have it, I try to wear minimal make up on my skin and this is perfect blend foundation! Highly recommend!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good coverage and goes on smoothly,"December 1, 2020",,5,"This does a great job at covering up dark circles and any imperfections. Choosing your color is a little difficult online, and I think the one I got is a little too yellow for me, but it's still a great product. It lasts a long time and seems to work with my skin type, which is normal but a little bit on the dry side."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,it is not moisture for my skin,"December 22, 2020",,4,"Covergirl Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer has lightweight formula and great for all-day wear.It provides natural-looking and covers well.Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer is made with coconut milk and aloe extracts. It is a Vegan product. Also, it is parabens and sulfates free.I like it. My only complain is it is not as moisture that it says. maybe my skin is very dry. anyway I use face lotion before apply this."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light and creamy formula,"March 29, 2020",580 Tan,5,"I don't love wearing alot of makeup - especially in the warmer months.  This is a very light and creamy formula.  It is very moisturizing as well so if you have oily skin I wouldn't recommend this product.  For me, I have dry skin and this gives me a nice sense of my skin feeling moisturized without feeling heavy.  Really pretty smooth finish and not cakey.  Great for a light coverage!*If this review made a difference for you, let me know and click the ""HELPFUL"" button."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very nice concealer,"October 4, 2020",,5,This concealer is a really nice consistency. It goes on smooth and blends well into the skin to help conceal blemishes. The tube is nice and small so it's easy to carry around. It didn't make my skin oily or dry and lasted for a full day. It comes as a little wand for easy application. I would totally recommend it.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Free of bad ingredients!,"December 28, 2019",560 Medium,4,"One of the great things about Cover Girl Clean Fresh Skin Milk, is that it’s free of some bad ingredients like formaldehyde and several more.  I’m trying to become more conscious of ingredients in the makeup I use.  I appreciate Cover Girl doing their part in trying to do away with these ingredients.  This makeup is lightweight and creamy. It spreads on easily with light coverage.  If you need a heavier coverage for scars etc. you would need a makeup with a heavier coverage.  Highly recommended!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for me!,"May 8, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,2,"I was very excited to try this out but, I was very disappointed after the hype. I really don't like the smell at all, In my opinion it doesn't even smell like Coconut, it smells like expired face lotion. They don't have a big variety of colors so It was challenging to find my color. After applying it to my face it couldn't really tell, my face turned a little white on that area. It doesn't work for me but maybe for Other girls with fair skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good light coverage concealer,"October 17, 2020",,4,COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer is great if you just need some light coverage.  I have very fair skin and I got the Fair Light color and it blends well with my natural skin tone.  It's very light weight and almost like you are not using any makeup at all. I have sensitive skin and I didn't notice any type of side effects or break outs from using this product. I'm a fan of Covergirl products.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,very good,"February 15, 2021",600 Rich,5,this applies so well and the color i perfect it lends and covers my acne scars amazingly an it doesnt look caked on i just wash my face and use my apricot scrub then i applly my primer and then this product and omg its good coverage my face looks smooth and a little goes a long way makes u look like you have natural clear looking glow. love it use it almost everyday  must try definitely
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,This is so orange and it has sparkles!,"December 16, 2020",,1,"Ugh, this is awful, really a horribly color. I tried it once, but it was a fail as I expected. I wish that I could have tried a color that would have been a more complimentary skin tone match. When I tried this it seemed very thin and sheer and did not seem to offer concealing. I definitely do not want sparkles in my under eye concealer.  On to something else."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great affordable powder!,"October 15, 2020",,5,"such a soft, lightweight powder. looks great over a bb cream for some extra coverage. also a great powder to touch up your makeup without making it look cakey. great for people with oily skin!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Does the job!,"September 29, 2020",,5,"As I have gotten older, I do not have as many blemishes, but coincidentally enough I got one and this did the job and last majority of the day. It was hard to match the pigment but it works well for blemishes. Just get it as close as you think, I probably could have gone a little darker but it still worked out."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice light coverage,"December 13, 2019",540 Light,5,Skin milk is a lot like a BB cream but not as thick. This provides a bit more coverage than tinted moisturizer. I always like Cover Girl and this is a nice addition. I’m using it a lot with just a bit of coverup and it’s perfect. I do use a separate moisturizer first because it’s winter and my skin gets dry. I don’t think I would need this in summer. It light and doesn’t feel like you even have anything on your face. Great if you don’t need much coverage

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Lightweight, easy to use","January 16, 2021",,4,"I like concealer in a wand. It makes it so easy to use and enhances precision for under eye application. This is a lightweight formula and seems very hydrating. The concealer provides a natural look and cover seems just right.  It's a dewy finish to leave skin not looking dry which can happen often under the eyes. It's  formulated without Formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates, or talc which makes me happy."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Works great!,"October 12, 2020",,5,"This product blends great, and adds extra coverage where you need it. The color I got was a little bit too light for me, but that didn't matter. It was close enough that it blended right in. Works well for both under eyes and as a spot treatment for blemishes. I have pretty sensitive skin and am always glad when a new product doesn't cause me any problems. I like this. Nice item to have in my makeup ""toolbox."""
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Awesome for dry skins,"August 3, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,4,"This foundation is really moisturizing, so I really like it since my skin is dry. The coverage is so light that's why I think it is a good foundation for daily usage. I ordered color rich/deep and unfortunately it is a little dark for me. But I use this with my everyday sunscreen cream and they blend together very well and it make the color less dark on my skin. I gave it 4 star just because it won't stay so long on your skin during the day."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I Use This Powder Instead of Foundation,"September 30, 2020",,5,"What I like most about this COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Pressed Powder Compact is that I can wear it on my face over my face lotion without any foundation, and it gives me a velvety, shine-free finish with no need for anything else on my face. It glides on smooth and matches my skin tone perfectly. The accompanying mirror in the compact is a nice convenience, too. It also keeps my face matte looking all day and doesn’t dry my skin out either."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Ashy,"September 22, 2020",,1,"I’ve long used translucent powder to set makeup, but I’m not a fan of this option. It doesn’t blend well at all and leaves even my super-pale skin looking ashy so I can’t imagine this working for those blessed with more melanin. It seems to cake and highlight areas of dry skin and fine lines, making me look haggard."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Nice powder and suited my skin, nice leathery feel foam puff","October 2, 2020",,5,I got the fair color and after patting it into my skin it looked good and took the oiliness away from my skin. interesting foam puff - the top fealt faux leathery(?) so it's easier to grip. Nothing much to say other than the powder didn't look thick or cakey on me. I like that it is free from all those bad ingredients and that it had natural ingredients added to it - aloe vera and tapioca.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,This is a perfect item for my daily routine,"January 20, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,After I clean and moisturize my face I then apply this wonderful porcelain cream onto my face to smooth out the color and make me look ready for the day.  If I didn't use this you would see all my freckles and dark spots and it would look bad.Because this cream is nearly a perfect match to my face color it looks like I'm not wearing any color and that is the look I am going for.Love this stuff and plan to NEVER EVER run out.Highly recommended...I am one happy customer for life.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Blends nicely.,"October 5, 2020",,5,"I've purchase 4 or 5 concealers in the past year. In the magnifying mirror I can see each one left dots on each of my pores and would not blend smoothly. This one is perfect, blends smoothly,  no more concealer filled pores and this product successfully covers my sometimes very present dark circles."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good for Everyday Wear, Not Full Coverage","July 20, 2020",620 Deep,3,"This product was a bit too thin for my liking. It’s more of a primer with a “tint”.  It took several applications to even see true coverage. However I did find it to be very moisturizing!! My skin felt super soft, even after removal which is a BIG plus!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Love the Lightness To This Foundation,"December 23, 2019",620 Deep,4,"Cover Girl , Clean Fresh Skin Milk Deep is a great foundation for a variety of reasons.  It does not contain parabens, talc, sulfates, phthalates or formaldehyde.  Its 100% vegan.  It contains aloe as well as coconut milk.  Its very light-you can't feel it sitting on your skin.  It does a great job of moisturizing skin as well.  I had no issues applying it to my face and it applied nice and even.  It didn't streak or cause any kind of blotching. With 14 different shades, there truly is a color for everyone."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great price for a vegan product,"September 10, 2021",,3,"This product is nice and sheer while also being moisturizing.  Unfortunately the sheerness did not work for me as a concealer,  I need high coverage . This is a wonderful product if just need a light coverage and want a clean and inexpensive product. I also like how well it blends into the skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,COVERGIRL CLEAN FRESH SKIN MILK TAN,"March 1, 2020",580 Tan,5,"This was so soft I mean soft smells great. Just feels amazing on. I put it on one side of my face, blends nicely, I did it with my fingers. This is buildable. I can make this darker for summer when I want a tan look. I didn't have any irritations. I believe anyone can use this product. Quality made. Love the NO talc, Paraben, Formaldeyhde, Phthalates, Mineral Oil, Sulfates and Fragrance. I can't go on about how great my skin felt. I hope this has helped. Thank You"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light and Clean Make-up! Skin Feels Hydrated!,"January 17, 2021",,5,"Covergirl Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer, 370 Medium Tan, 0.23 Fl OzColor matches nicely! I like how the tube is like lip-gloss so you can just put the concealer where you want to apply it! The make-up is nice and light - very clean feeling next to your skin!  It's like it is not even there! Plus it is very moisturizing! Highly Recommend! 5 Stars! Hope you found this review helpful!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for me,"October 13, 2020",,3,"The packaging on this is cute and it smells nice, but the overall product is kind of lacking. The translucent one I got applied to the face unevenly and leaves a terrible white dusting even after you brush it off. It left my face feeling drier than the average face powder and didn’t have anything that really stood out. It did make my face matte which was nice, but there’s a ton of products that do the same thing but better."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,My trusted brand,"January 1, 2021",,5,"I have a lot of allergies to common chemicals found in most beauty products and cover girl is one of the few big commercial brands that I can use. The quality is good as expected. The only thing with this, is if I don’t use a good enough moisturizer beforehand, this will dry out my face."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I’m impressed!,"October 9, 2020",,5,"I typically use Tarte Shape Tape and it works great so I had little expectation for this. It has a similar consistency, but goes on more thin in comparison. I prefer a more thick concealer, but for how thin this is, I was impressed with its longevity. The photo with my review is after 8 hours of wear! If you like a more light makeup, this is an impressive product!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Hydrates while blurring imperfections.,"December 25, 2019",600 Rich,5,"This formula is lightweight and provides light coverage. My favorite thing about it is that it moisturizes my skin and relieves dryness. It has improved the dry patches on my face, and leaves my skin feeling more supple and less tight. It seemingly blurs out the appearance of imperfections."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light weight coverage that is perfect for the weekends!,"December 15, 2019",540 Light,5,"I like to wear lighter makeup on the weekends, and this one is perfect.  It covers well, but doesn't sit heavy on my skin.  I have light skin, and this color matches my skin well.  It is easy to apply, and hasn't caused any irritation to my face.  It is easy to wash off with cleanser.  It lasts all day, and its affordable.  That works for me!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl is always good stuff,"October 6, 2020",,5,"COVERGIRL Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder, 0.35 Ounce, 120 Fair (99350052603)Always a Covergirl fan and this isn't any different.  It worked well and was exactly what was expected.  It was packaged well and was not broken in transit.  Unfortunately that happens all to often with this sort of thing.  It went on well and lasts through the day, even with exercise.  The color was as expected."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light Concealer,"September 28, 2020",,4,This concealer does a pretty good job of covering up blemishes and under eye areas. I would consider it having a light to medium coverage type. It blends well. It did not cause my skin any issues such as break outs or redness. I've tried some pretty expensive concealers in the past and I think this does almost as good of a job as some of those. I would recommend giving this one a try.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,This is more of a foundation than anything,"December 11, 2019",520 Fair,4,"The CoverGirl clean fresh arrived and the first thing I noticed, it's not really that big, but it's an ok size.  It's lightweight and goes on very easy.  It's more of a foundation than moisturizer.  I think it works very well as it goes on smoothly and easy to remove. It doesn't seem to last as long as others thought I noticed.Very decent foundation that is not heavy and looks natural, it also gives a nice glow to the skin. This definitely works better on youthful skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Meh,"January 2, 2020",560 Medium,2,"I'm not a makeup snob and I do like a lot of Cover Girl products, but this foundation wasn't a winner. Maybe the moisturizing feature made it too heavy a coverage for me, but it was hard to blend out (even with a beauty sponge). It didn’t irritate my skin, so there's that. But this wasn’t even as good for me as the low-end Cover Girl foundation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,very nice,"October 7, 2020",,4,this is a very nice product. I generally do not like compact powders as they leave a chalky look. Not this one. Glides on easily and looks natural. Good at cover-ups. I am very happy and recommend it. The pad applicator works wellas well and is so easily rinsed ut to keep it clean.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Shimmer alert! would be perfect otherwise,"December 24, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"At first, this really checks most of the boxes for me. It's got a nice safe ingredient list, it's cruelty free, super light weight coverage, no scent, no irritation, highly blendable ✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️ then something bad happened. I noticed shimmer. I don't do shimmer on my entire face. I don't mind a subtle ""glow"" in certain areas I want highlighted, but I'm not an all over shimmer kind of gal. I realize that won't bother everyone, but for me it will keep me from ordering this one again."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Fair/Light, Skim Milky freshness!","December 1, 2019",530 Fair/Light,5,"This creamy mixture goes on so smoothly! I just love that. The light color matches my skin tone nicely. It's hardly noticeable which is good. I like that it covers some of my red spots, blemishes, unsightly acne marks. It feels clean and my face doesn't feel dry after applying it. The tube it came in was a bit smaller (also very flat) than I thought it would be but I don't use very much during each application. Something I recommend you try for yourself! :)"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for Dry skin,"December 6, 2019",520 Fair,3,I have really dry skin and this water based foundation doesn't work well for me. You will have to make sure you hydrate your skin really well 15-30 min before using this since moisturizers tend to be oil based. I wore this for around 3 hours only and I saw it sitting very unflatteringly on my dry spots. It catches onto the white heads and accentuates it too (and I dont have that many).Pros- It spreads very nicely and I did not experience any oxidation for the time I wore it.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Wonderful, and I don't usually love any foundation","December 17, 2019",510 Porcelain,5,"Normally I hate the feel of a foundation on my face. Although I picked the Porcelain shade, it's fine now in the winter but I'd probably have to go one shade darker in the summer. It feels so light, like I'm wearing nothing but a moisturizer. It hides some dark spots I have on my face and never turns orange. The only way this could be better is if it had a high SPF built-in."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Decent coverage, terrible scent","December 14, 2019",510 Porcelain,3,"I have always enjoyed Covergirl makeup. The color is nice as well as the lightweight coverage. The thing I can't stand is the scent of this makeup. It is terrible. I'm not sure I can use it unless the scent dissipates over time. The makeup has a label certifying it Vegan, but I'm not sure if that is the reason for the scent or just another descriptor."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Lightweight, not much coverage","October 18, 2020",,4,"This concealer is very lightweight and watery. If you are looking for coverage this is not for you. I bought the light medium tone (350), at first I thought it was too light for my skin but once you tap it (as it was very liquidity) the color matched perfectly! I have very dry skin and this concealer doesn’t dry my skin. If you want something sheer and light for the summer you might really like this."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for mature skin,"December 8, 2019",530 Fair/Light,3,"I'm new to using makeup, so I'm still trying to figure out the best way to use products and evaluate them.This skin milk matched my skin tone perfectly. However, it is such a light coverage that it looks almost like I have nothing on at all. This might be fine for more youthful skin (kind of like the training bra of makeup; mostly to make the wearer feel mature even though it basically does nothing). I need more coverage for my mature skin. Now I know to avoid skin milks."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight on the skin,"September 24, 2020",,4,"This pressed powder works well. I got the 120 tone. It has lightweight coverage consistency. It applies to the skin evenly and stays on for long. I also like the package design. It has mirror and foam puff, and is also comfortable to open and close. The only issue I have is that it’s not an exact match for my skin tone, so powder is visible on my face. I like everything else about the product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,nice soft foundation.,"January 3, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,4,"I would say this foundation does what it says it will do on the label. It was very soft and moisturizing during the summer heat on my vacation. Cover wise however its low to medium coverage. I could still see the redness from mosquito bites on my skin. I'm not sure why it's called ""milk"" however, I suspect it's just a trendy name."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Color is too dark,"November 7, 2020",,3,I didn't care for this product.  I usually use medium or light medium makeup but this looked way too dark for medium.  Couldn't use it.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pressed powder feels a little thick,"October 3, 2020",,4,"It comes in a nice compact. I use a porcelain foundation and I used light pale (140) pressed powder. It works good for me as color goes. It doesn’t feel as think as the previous bare essentials did but I would still like to find one that is even lighter, less thick feeling. I will use it until I find what I’m looking for because this doesn’t feel bad but it could be better."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Doesn’t crease.,"September 28, 2020",,5,I don’t wear a lot of makeup.On my most basic days just mascara and blush.I’ve learned recently that I need to be wearing concealer (one shade lighter) under my eyes - I’m getting older.This concealer doesn’t crease into my wrinkles or pores.It helps to brighten up my eyes which is so important now that I’m wearing a mask and that is what most people see of my face!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Not my favorite concealer, good color match","December 17, 2020",,4,"This concealer was not my favorite. I felt like my powder set a little funny on it, and my under eyes still had some creasing. To their credit, I felt like I was able to easily match my color with the photos online. It was the exact color I need, so I'm willing to work with it. It did last a long time which was nice, but you will need to work with it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Decent coverage, buildable","October 11, 2020",,4,"I used this on top of my foundation to lighten up the area under my eyes. It blended nicely with my beauty blender. The applicator isn’t the greatest but I just used it to sit under my eye anyways. I topped it off with some powder, and I was good to go for the rest of the day.  I would recommend it as a great drugstore brand to use."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Sheer and lightweight,"September 25, 2020",,4,"If you are looking for a lightweight face powder, this may be the one for you. This is perfect for just that touch of powder to take the shine off. It doesn't add any color to your skin. It just gives you that ""finished"" look. It comes with an applicator, but I prefer to use a brush."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good, reasonably priced concealer","September 28, 2020",,5,"I am middle aged, so instead of covering pimples, I now use concealer to cover age spots and other assorted “imperfections”.  So when this CoverGirl Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer was available to me through the Amazon Vine program, I ordered it.  I like it.  This lightweight concealer does a decent job covering flaws, plus it is affordable, available in several shades, and made in the USA."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light coverage concealer,"September 23, 2020",,3,"This concealer is hydrating but it’s not full coverage, it’s light at best. It feels comfortable on the skin but really doesn’t cover acne very well. I like using this under my eyes more than for spot concealing as it is hydrating and I have dry under eyes."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Feels like a BB cream :),"December 13, 2019",560 Medium,5,"Soft moisturizing product. It goes on smooth and lightweight. Feels a bit more like a BB cream rather than foundation, but I don’t like heavy makeup, so it was perfect for my taste.Easy to use for a quick application for a busy mom!I am Latina with light Mexican skin with yellow undertones. Felt like the product was slightly light for me, so next time I’ll look for another shade.Would recommend for anyone who hardly has time to get ready in the morning."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Blends very smoothly super light on the face,"January 17, 2020",520 Fair,5,This is a very light weight foundation.  When it sets you don't need to use powder if you don't want to.  A setting spay will work just fine.  You can see in the photos how this comes out and what it looks like rubbed in and set on my hand.  This feels like nothing when it is on.  Washes off easily with soap& water or makeup remover.  Doesn't cause a rash or breakouts when using.  Has no noticeable scent
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,This product worked perfectly for me,"October 1, 2020",,5,"I am a mature woman and have a few ""age"" spots and redness on my face...ughhhh. I don't like heavy concealers that are claylike, this product covers the problem spots but with a lighter, moisturing cream.  I do add a foundation on top and my skin looks good.Currently the price is$8.94 with Prime and free returns.  That's awesome that they back up their product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Okay concealer.,"September 28, 2020",,3,"Its an okay concealer. I magically have no acne right now (drink your water ladies) so I tested this on a tattoo. First pic is without any, second with one pass. Third with 2 passes. So it's definitely buildable but remember most liquid concealer really shows wrinkles in the skin but it did an okay job covering considering acne would be more red and my tattoo is black."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Too Dark,"May 19, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,3,"As with everything Covergirl, good quality. However, too dark for my skin tone. I believe I need to go a shade lighter. It's also very lightweight so doesn't feel caked on. I wore it through a normal day, and by midday it was kind of washed off. Also my skin felt a little oily. I have combination skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good makeup,"September 28, 2020",,5,"This is a decent type of makeup. I have really sensitive skin and do not tolerate much in the way of makeup, so it is always a great find to see a brand take out bad ingredients and chemicals and make a more natural type to try. So far this is working well for me. It goes on smooth and covers well. It is a vegan product, so those who are vegetarian/vegan will like this one."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great for combination skin,"November 4, 2020",,4,"I have sensitive combination skin, and this is just perfect for my skin. It feels very soft and silky on without feeling like it dried out my skin. Applies easily and offers light to medium coverage. Great for touchups. Doesn't have a strong scent. Wears well and evenly throughout the day. Overall, great powder."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It's okay,"December 20, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,3,"This is a thin 1 ounce tube of foundation. The size would be good to try the product, or good for traveling, however the price is expensive for what it is. It doesn't really cover all that well though and not as good as other foundations. I rated it higher because I do like the fact that its paraben free & cruelty free. It did not cause any irritation, & it was easy to apply."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl skin milk foundation,"December 30, 2019",510 Porcelain,4,Covergirl clean fresh skin milk foundation. This is a lightweight light coverage foundation. If you need light sheer coverage for slight redness or as a base for a already good complexion this is for you. If you need decent coverage or full coverage this is not for you at all. The foundation is nice and light and goes on easily and blends well. The moisturizing properties are decent and it didnt make me breakout. Good light coverage and natural finish.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good concealer,"September 25, 2020",,5,- Good concealer that lasts for the majority of the day.- Natural looking when blended into the rest of the skin.- Applicator is narrow and similar to other applicators Covergirl uses.  Pretty easy to use.- I’m not bothered by the smell.  It smells like other makeup.- 7 ml (.23 oz) is a narrow tube and easy fits in a pocket or bag.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It's VEGAN!!,"July 31, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,5,You can never go wrong with vegan foundation! It goes on smoothly. It gives my skin a natural glow. I only need to used a little which goes a long way. It nourishes my pale looking skin. I would recommend this vegan foundation to my friends and family.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great if you want glitter on your face,"September 30, 2020",,2,"It’s really dumb that they have lumped together powder, foundation, and concealer. This review is for the translucent powder.It works okay. It definitely takes away shine. But then it adds back...glitter. It has fine pieces of mica in it. So you get here and there spots that look like you have glitter on your face. What the heck? Definitely don’t want that."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not bad but just ok.,"January 3, 2021",,3,I don't have anything bad or good to say about this one. It wears well and is just ok. It seemed to accentuate my dryness under my eyes but I'm also in winter. I'll keep giving it a try and see if it's more seasonal or just right now for me.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Very sheer, lightweight concealer","December 27, 2020",,3,This concealer is very lightweight. Very. Lightweight. This is not for someone who has any dark circles that need correcting or any dark acne they would like to cover. This is for someone who has very minor corrections/perfecting to do.  It's a moisturizing formula which is nice - just understand the limitations of this product. ~Amy
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Surprised!!!,"August 4, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,5,"I am actually pleasantly surprised by house much I love this product. I’m normally a full coverage..you can definitely tell I have makeup on..kind of girl. This stuff though, it’s weightless, natural looking, and makes my skin feel soft. I found my new favorite foundation for sure!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Woudln't buy,"January 10, 2020",530 Fair/Light,3,"This isn't a makeup I would purchase after using it. It was much darker than expected and was almost chunky coming out of the tube. I wasn't happy with the way it looked. The makeup settled into every line and pore on my face. Overall, it wasn't very flattering and I wouldn't recommend it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,A trusted brand,"December 30, 2019",520 Fair,5,"I've been using Cover Girl products for years, in fact I remember my mom using it back in the 70's. So I was not hesitant to try the  Clean Fresh Skin Milk.  It goes on smoothly and doesn't feel heavy and lasts all day.  There is a scent that does dissipate fairly quickly, but it's noticeable when you first apply i."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,this is a foundation that will go to the girl,"December 11, 2019",510 Porcelain,4,"I have old, dry skin that requires a foundation that is more than dewy. This foundation, to me, is made for younger people who still are getting blemishes. It does a nice job covering up imperfections. Personally, I need the blurring ability and lots of it. This is good though. I have used Clairol products in my younger years."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Sheer To Control Shine,"September 29, 2020",,5,"I still get shiny on the t-zone of my complexion no matter what, so having a product like this really helps. I used blotting papers and then applied this translucent sheer pressed powder. It took the shine away immediately. It also didn't make my face dry or look cakey. The small size fits in my purse, not taking up much room. Recommended."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I use this in a dark shade for contouring,"October 28, 2020",,4,"Good for powder contouring. I definitely wouldn’t use this as an all over face pressed powder it just shows on the skin to much, and don’t really blend/brush off well. Good product, but for something other than its intended use. It’s great for buffing/contouring!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Wow!,"October 8, 2020",,5,"I looooove this formula! It covers & hides little imperfections and doesn't dry my sensitive skin out. It's super fresh, light, doesn't feel like I have anything heavy on my face. Blends smoothly and easily, long lasting! Definitely a keeper!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Cakey and drying,"May 25, 2021",,3,I don't love this concealer. It almost seems to highlight my undereye bags rather than conceal them. The product settles into my fine lines and makes them appear worse than they are. The product smears easily and is just kind of a mess in general.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Finally found the right color !,"December 24, 2019",560 Medium,4,I finally found the perfect color ! This gives you a nice light coverage on your face that smooths into your skin so nicely. Its so hard for me to find the right color online when trying a brand I haven't tried before and I usually end up disappointed but this color is so close to the color that's shown. This doesn't look cakie and you only need a small amount. I'm very happy with this brand and color.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Ok,"April 29, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,4,"This Covergirl foundation came in a darker color than my natural shade. So I will base this review based on my observations. The product smoothly and easily spreads on skin. I don't like the smell, it stinks, luckily the smell dissipates. There are micro tiny sparkles into this formula which actually looks very pretty. The staying power is good but it does not cover moles or imperfections."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder,"November 24, 2020",,4,I have used Cover Girl cosmetics for years and like them. This Cover Girl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder keeps skin fresh and smooth looking by absorbing and preventing oil and shine. It doesn't get clumpy or turn my face orange.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Sheer coverage, feels great on my skin","January 17, 2020",530 Fair/Light,4,"This foundation is very different from other foundations I've tried. The coverage is sheer and light and it would be perfect for summer months. My skin looks very fresh! It's moisturizing and makes my skin feel nice and soft and it doesn't dry out quickly. It's easy to blend and doesn't leave streaks, either. Overall I'm pretty happy with Clean Fresh Skin Milk foundation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good Quality Concealer, Lasts All Day!","June 14, 2021",,5,"I had heard a lot of good things about this concealer so I decided to give it a try. It applies sheer and well, and a little product goes a long way as far as blending. It doesn't get clumpy, nor does it crease. It is a good quality concealer that lasts all day."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice,"October 12, 2020",,5,The color was a great match for my skin tone. There isn’t any sort of smell that I’ve noticed. The size of it is perfect. I don’t use the little sponge that came with it. I most prefer to use this as a setting powder. I’d recommend if you like pressed powder makeups.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,conceals great,"October 7, 2020",,5,After using this on my face there is a night and day difference. It conceals very easily and I found the applications to be long lasting as I did not have to reapply it at all. The tube is nice a sleek and fits easily in my makeup bag.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Sandra's View ""stinky""","April 28, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,3,"I received 1 ounce of Cover girl clean fresh scent. The product is supposed to nourish the skin. The product contains coconut milk and aloe extract. The product is vegan. The product is has no Formaldehyde, phthalates, parabens, sulfates and talc. The product is cruelty free. The product is lightweight and goes on well. I do not like the smell. Overall it is ok."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Excellent Color, Great Feeling","September 22, 2020",510 Porcelain,3,Very moisturizing that doesnt leave the face drying out after a few hours. Blends into the complexion well. Great scent too.Overall just wish it was a bigger product size as it can run out fast with daily use.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,No unwanted scent,"November 24, 2020",,4,"This is a great concealer. It is moisturizing, hydrating and last a while. The applicator is good and it is easy to apply precisely and is best used for the under eyes. The best part is that it has no unwanted scent which is great for sensitive people and pregnant ladies."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight foundation,"December 21, 2019",520 Fair,5,"I don’t wear foundation often, but when I do, I prefer foundations that are lightweight. This foundation has worked for me. A lot of the foundations that I’ve tried have very yellow tones, which don’t work for me. This foundation matched up with my fair/pink undertone skin. It was very lightweight, didn’t cake up, and provided the coverage I need for my skin. I will continue purchasing this foundation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight coverage and feel. Wears well.,"January 4, 2020",560 Medium,4,"I have the Covergirl concealer in medium and the skin milk is the same shade it is thinner than the concealer but matches my skin tone well. The foundation is not particularly opaque however.Pictured: the top is Covergirl's medium skin milk, middle is Pretty vulgar's unveiled queen and the bottom is Revlon's tawney.Note, I am allergic to coconut oil but the coconut milk did not cause issues."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight but not very effective,"July 31, 2020",600 Rich,3,"This feels great and definitely made my skin feel moisturized. However, it was not very effective at covering up blemishes or redness on my skin. I would need to use this with concealer underneath, it is not enough on its own."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Too sheer for me,"October 4, 2020",,3,"This would be perfect for folks that only need the merest hint of concealer.  It did nothing to cover my under eye circles.  Also, the wand is small, so I had to swipe it over the circles several times to cover the entire area.  The description says it has “buildable coverage”, but I didn’t find that multiple layers helped."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Lightweight, Moisturizing and Smells good too!!!","December 16, 2019",620 Deep,4,"Too bad I was sent the ""Deep"" color which is WAY too dark for me....I wanted the ""Light/Medium"" which would have matched my skin tone SO much better....this is very lightweight, creamy moisturizing and smells fresh!!  Too bad I will have to give it away...hoping the next foundation is Light or Medium!!!  Thank you!!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I glow a little,"January 7, 2020",530 Fair/Light,5,"I really like that this doesn’t have all the nasty chemicals so many products have, it has to be better for my skin. This goes on easily and looks natural , I do use a primer under this ( all makeup) so my skin looks flawless . I often have people asking what I do to my skin since it looks “younger then I am”:) this is super moisturizing and has a nice light scent."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,My own issue,"September 28, 2020",,5,"Well this product works great, I do have light skin and when I ordered this I didn't realize the color was RICH.  I did think it was just  a clear blotting powder.  SO that being said, on a lighter skinned person this still looks nice as a bronzer for me!  So its usable and it leaves me shine free!!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Small grains in product,"May 31, 2020",530 Fair/Light,3,"Before I purchased this I’d read that it left little bits behind, like little pillings or small grains in it. I bought it anyway thinking maybe my prep routine could avoid it. But nope! After really inspecting the product I found the actual product has the little grains in it! I don’t know what it is. But I’ve seen many complaints about the same issue of the pilling/grains. Sucks because it’s a great shear lightweight natural foundation but these little grains that comes with it aren’t something that can be avoided."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Just ok,"October 7, 2021",,4,"I dont love this like I thought I would. It's pretty good but very light coverage and I guess maybe I need more than it provides. It does have great ingredients, however, so that is what attracted me in the first place."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very smooth,"December 20, 2019",510 Porcelain,5,This gives you a very smooth light coverage. You can still see your skin and freckles. This is what I love about this. I don't like the mask foundations whatsoever. This is very natural.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Convenient Compact for freshening up make-up,"December 8, 2020",,5,"I like this powder compact.  It's convenient enough to carry in my purse for freshening makeup on the go, but I also use it daily when I'm putting on my makeup as a setting powder.  It's sheer enough that I don't look like I'm wearing powder all over my face yet ""strong"" enough to set my makeup and avoid shine."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,A Unique Name Choice,"December 8, 2019",640 Dark,4,"Skin milk, a quite unique name for a foundation but it really does have a type of milk in it and that’s coconut milk. The fragrance is quite nice and the foundation applies easily. Has moisturizers to keep the skin hydrated. Packaged in a one fluid ounce container for convenient carry. Four Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice concealer,"September 17, 2020",,4,Lightweight and easy to applet and blend. The applicator doesn’t take too much product out at once so you can apply till you build up the way you want it. Is very mess free. It has a nice consistency... overall it didn’t blew my mind but is a good concealer for this price. I did not caked under my eyes either.I hope that helps.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Five stars,"January 19, 2020",600 Rich,5,I actually LOVE this foundation. I am shocked covergirl makes such a wonderful product. It says log hit coverage but i found this to cover active acne and scars well. It left my skin feeling moisturized but not greasy at all. I hate when I can feel my makeup on my face but this is lightweight. It stayed all day as well! I am switching to this completely when my current makeup runs out!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Stocking up on this stuff!,"October 1, 2020",,5,"Blown away with this powder! When trying this on a freshly washed and dried face, I powdered up and snapped a photo. I could not believe it! I literally looked like I used a filter, or at the very least some foundation. Nope, it was all this powder and it’s Covergirl which is even more surprising. Definitely stocking up."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Seems to moisturize,"August 13, 2020",510 Porcelain,3,"Soooo... I ordered the wrong color, however I will review all the same.  It IS moisturizing and applies evenly.  Doesn't make my skin feel dry.  I really wish I had chosen the correct color.  :(  Thank you."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder,"November 7, 2020",,4,I really like this Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder it just gives you minimal coverage. It is a breathable lightweight powder that covers evenly. It is perfect for touch-ups throughout the day. It a great size to take with you.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Skin Milk, Deep/Dark","December 5, 2019",630 Deep/Dark,3,"OOPS! I received the wrong shade, much too dark. I tried it anyway for the review. It is medium weight and dries very quickly. Actually so quickly I couldn’t get it smoothed on evenly. I wasn’t thrilled with the scent but it doesn’t linger.  I think it must last very well because I put a patch on my hand and it was still there after I had washed the dishes. Maybe a sign I should use a stronger dish soap?"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good coverage,"December 15, 2019",560 Medium,3,"This definitely is not my favorite, aside from the color being slightly off, it doesn't go on very easily.  It does give a decent coverage with minimal product and last most of the day.  And I do like that it keeps the oil/shine under control.  So that's a big bonus."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great value and most decent product!,"September 30, 2020",,5,"I love this powder! It's completely matte and helps tremendously with keeping shine to a minimum. Yet, it still has a buildable quality to it. The shade is perfect for me. And honestly pretty accurate from the photos online. For a drugstore product, I'm very happy!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice gentle foundation,"December 15, 2019",510 Porcelain,5,"The Cover Girl Clean Fresh Skin Milk foundation is a nice, gentle foundation. It eases up on the ingredients to provide light coverage in a fresh-feeling treatment. It blends well and you only need a little to complete your look. Wears well, lasting all day. No adverse reactions to this with my sensitive skin. Very happy with this."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very moisturizing concealer!,"September 18, 2020",,4,"Great concealer! Feels moisturizing! Doesn’t feel cakey. Seemed to stay put all day. I don’t have crazy dark circles to cover or anything so not sure how it would cover those but for normal tired mom  eyes, this covers great :)"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,didn't like this,"March 31, 2020",550 Light/Medium,3,"I have a light-medium skin tone and this did noting for me - it didn't add balance, it didn't give me a fresh glow. I just felt pale and tired looking when I wore it, like it just washed me out. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin and had a very mild fragrance that was barely detectable. It went on smooth if I used. primer but not otherwise."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great Concealer,"April 11, 2021",,5,This is a really nice concealer that provides optimal coverage. I apply this on my face prior to my foundation and it helps cover my dark spots and acne marks. It's very lightweight and spreads easily.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Beautiful compact.,"September 28, 2020",,5,This powder is wonderful. It goes on so clean and smooth. The compact is really durable and a beautiful pink. I love it! You can throw it in your bag and not worry you’ll break it. I used the little pad that came with it but will most likely use a brush when I apply it. Very light and fresh.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great option for a natural look but goes on watery so watch out for drips.,"December 12, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,This foundation is more watery than I expected so watch for drips when you use. It has a very natural finish that I really like. If you have oily skin this does a great job at reducing shine. I do think this is a great option for light coverage. It reduces redness without looking heavy. It had no odor that I noticed. This is a great option for an everyday look.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,The Best Coverage Ever!!!,"July 21, 2020",600 Rich,5,"I was a tad skeptical with the quality, since it arrived kinda busted, but I cleaned it up and started to use and and now I am completely hooked. It fills in where it needs to, is light weight and makes my skin look flawless. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality makeup.xoxo Haley"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pretty Good,"January 2, 2020",540 Light,4,"This is a pretty good foundation but not my favorite.  It is light & it feels slightly moisturizing.  If you have very oily skin, I don’t think you’ll like this formula.  The coverage is OK & the finish is dewy.  I have an oily t-zone & it held up ok over the day but not great.  It does feel nice & did not make me break out."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great concealer,"September 30, 2020",,5,"This concealer goes on smoothly, blends easily, and stays put all day.The applicator is a small sponge brush. I applied the concealer, put on foundation, and took a big fluffy brush to blend it all. The look is natural but polished, and it feels light.Great value, too!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice...,"December 4, 2019",530 Fair/Light,4,"I like this product, it is gentle on my sensitive skin. The color is looks good on my olive complexion. The foundation isn't too heavy. A little goes a long way. I don't like a heavy foundation; I prefer a light coverage and this one is perfect."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Bad product,"December 7, 2020",,1,"I’m not a fan. It’s supposed to be hydrating but only left my skin feeling super dry and chalky. It didn’t absorb into my skin very well, and later I noticed it was starting to separate in the tube. It’s probably pretty old product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Blends well,"March 15, 2020",640 Dark,5,The foundation is light and blends well.  It makes my face looks very natural like I have nothing on.  I apply a little and it last most of the day.  My face feels fresh and moisturized while wearing it.  The foundation goes on smooth and provides maximum coverage with little to no touch ups.  I would say it gave me a flawless finish.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Goes on even and lasts,"September 25, 2020",,5,"This is a great concealer, though it does seem a bit lighter than I should have ordered. It goes on even and blends well. It lasts, too. Doesn't feel too dry or oily on my skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not Much Coverage,"September 26, 2020",,3,"This is very hydrating, and goes on nice and smooth. But as soon as I try to blend it in, it simply disappears. I use concealer for my very dark undereyes, and I tried it under one eye and simply don't see a difference when compared to the other. Perhaps when added with foundation it will be better."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Goes on nicely and stays on all day,"September 27, 2020",,5,"I like this powder it helps reduce the shine from my skin. I like how it  looks on my skin and that it stays all day long, I like that it is cruelty free as well as paraben free. I'm very pleased with how this product performs for me on my skin and I will buy this product again."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Disappointment,"November 6, 2020",510 Porcelain,1,I bought this at CVS cause it looked decent I didn’t check reviews which was a mistake. I went home and applied it to half my face because I like seeing the difference and then I waiting about 20 minutes to look back in the mirror and see it oxidized to a yellowish color than when it started out. It looked dusty and cake-y. Not the few finish it advertised. Also this has never happened to me but I broke out in hives on my cheek where I applied it :( One picture is of the cheek I applied it on with hives and the other is the clean cheek with no application
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Face foundation,"October 7, 2020",600 Rich,4,This foundation is perfect for daily use.  It will keep skin moisturized while it provides an even skin tone.  Packaging is small so it can ft easily in the bathroom or one can easily place it in a purse.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great for contouring,"February 19, 2021",,5,"My wife has medium golden skin, and she loves this powder for creating more contrast for her cheekbones, forehead and nose. The ""Deep"" color is perfect for this! Looks very natural, blends without blotching. Sheer coverage, no shine or glitter, nice glow."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not For My Skin Tone,"December 12, 2020",,3,"I understand that the computer screen is not a 100% accurate representation of what the color will look like. I wanted to use this to cover up minor blemishes, however, the medium color I received was a little too peach/orange for me. It might work for other skin tones though."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very lightweight!,"December 8, 2019",630 Deep/Dark,5,"I hate to call this foundation because it is so light but for the sake of this review, I will. This foundation was super easy to apply and it provided a smooth light covering. It covered small imperfections on my skin. I guess you could say, it gave me a polished look without looking like I was covered in makeup. I love this!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It separates before opening the packaging,"November 13, 2020",,2,I was excited to try the product. However the liquid and the pigment separated before the first time opening. I don’t feel comfortable to apply it on my face. Very disappointed.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Laughable Coverage,"April 19, 2020",530 Fair/Light,1,"I typically don’t leave reviews on makeup, but I had to with this. This foundation is horrible.It smells. It’s very watery. Laughable coverage. It’s SUPER sheer...like to the point where there’s absolutely no reason to use it. It’s not buildable whatsoever. It also sinks into your pores and makes them more noticeable.I don’t have sensitive skin and my complexion is very clear. After using this ONE time, my whole face has broken out (not exaggerating)."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Long lasting,"January 4, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,5,"Longs lasting with very good coverage.  Easy to apply, the consistency glides easy on the skin.  I have combination skin and it works great for me.  It is gentle on the dry areas and oil control on the nose.  Good product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,As expected,"September 26, 2020",,5,This translucent keeps me oil-free for several hours (I have very oily skin). The packaging is nice and durable. There is a little bit of fall-out when I use a powder brush. I recommend this product!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Love it,"December 4, 2019",540 Light,5,"I've used Covergirl products for years, so I was excited to try this new line, Clean Fresh. Brilliant! This product is very much like a moisturizer, but still has enough foundation in it to cover spots and to even out your complexion. This will definitely be included in my must have make up list."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Blended well,"January 20, 2022",,5,"Speaking for Myself, I’m not a big makeup person, but this does the job. I like natural look, camera ready. Applying was smooth, I used the blended sponge, applied nicely."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Felt heavy and unnatural,"April 1, 2020",540 Light,3,"I felt this product brought out imperfections instead of covering them up.  I also did not find it to be light or moisturizing.  To me, it felt uncomfortably heavy and unnatural.  After a very short-time using, my skin started to break out.  If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend this product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Light, non-sticky tinted moisturizer","December 3, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,4,"I like tinted moisturizer on days that I don't want to do the full makeup routine. That's what I would consider this product to be. I wish I had gotten the light/medium. That would have been my color. This medium/tan is quite dark. But it doesn't feel sticky or heavy, which is my big complaint with foundations. This could be my new everyday base coat."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Sheer,"January 13, 2021",,4,It is sheer. It goes on nicely. The applicator can carry too much product so do watch that when you want to daub under your eyes. Too much and you can experience the wonderful feeling of concealer in your eye. This experience is very much not recommended.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight coverage.,"October 1, 2020",,4,"This Covergirl concealer is lightweight and covers fairly well. It blends easily onto my skin and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy.  The wand applicator is handy for dabbing onto small spots, such as blemishes or freckles."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Works well,"December 26, 2020",,5,The applicator brush is a good size for small areas and holds the liquid without dripping. The concealer dried quickly and uniformly. The concealer lasted several hours before reapplying.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Really great!,"July 22, 2020",630 Deep/Dark,4,I decided to do half my face with the foundation and leave the other side natural. And it looked absolutely great on my skin it covered my dark areas perfectly but I was still able to see my pimples but this is a good product for medium coverage.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Great color match, good concealer.","September 17, 2020",,5,Sometimes it's difficult to find a good color match concealer for fairer skin. This is a great match. Typical Covergirl quality without the old harmful additives.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"covers well, not super dark","December 27, 2019",520 Fair,5,"My daughter was worried that this would be too dark when she first saw it, but after trying it she said it was lighter than expected.  She has very fair skin.  It's a good foundation for her.  Highly recommended."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Color is not even,"May 2, 2021",,4,"Not sure if I got a defective one, the color is not even in the bottle. It’s a little dry for me it got chunky very easy.The quality is horrible overall."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Amazing foundation!!!!,"July 21, 2020",600 Rich,5,"The media could not be loaded.
                




   I love how it color matched my skin so good I’ve been looking all over for the perfect shade of foundation and I found it!! It’s vegan,I like how lightweight it is it doesn’t feel heavy on the skin the coconut milk and aloe leaves a moisturizing finish. Would totally recommend if u looking for something moisturizing And not heavy at all."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Little and easy to carry in your pocket to reapply!,"June 9, 2021",,4,"It works as any other concealer, nothing fancy about it. I like that I can stick it in my jeans pocket for the road and reapply as needed throughout the day."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good powder that's healthier for my skin.,"September 16, 2020",,5,"It's always a toss up with makeup on whether it's going to do the job, or bug my skin. This covergirl powder didn't irritate me and it looked great all day."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Effective light weight foundation,"June 16, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,4,"Despite the ""skin milk"" name, this is a higher end foundation makeup product.As such it goes on well and provides a nice foundation without looking or feeling like a layer of clay.Good choice and available in many different tones."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Moisturizing and Lightweight,"January 14, 2020",530 Fair/Light,5,"I absolutely love this foundation! It reminds me of a BB cream but provides a bit more coverage. It goes on smooth and creamy and provides just the right amount of moisture. It's lightweight so it doesn't clog my pores but it covers imperfections. I also really like that it has no sulfates, phthalates, or parabens and is 100% vegan."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Best foundation,"May 3, 2020",550 Light/Medium,5,"This is the best foundation I have ever worn. It matches my skin perfectly and looks extremely natural.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good product overall!,"February 29, 2020",600 Rich,4,"Overall, this isn't a bad foundation. It isn't one of my favorites but it does the job. I do not care for the scent personally I find all covergirl products to be overly scented but as far as coverage, it is lightweight as it claims and moisturizing I found it to be as well so I would recommend it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good, Not Great","December 6, 2019",610 Rich/Deep,4,"The wife says it's OK, but not great. I can only accept that at face value (no pun intended - mostly) It works, and it isn't real pricey apparently so it seems OK for four stars, but not five.She did say it went on well and was easy to smooth and blend though, and perhaps that should factor in...?"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Works well for me,"December 13, 2019",560 Medium,5,"I wasnt sure about trying this but it did work fairly well for me.  The color is a smidge light but ery workable.  It felt lightweight and was easy to blend.Did not cause any breakouts,  Yea!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Extremely liquidy,"October 8, 2020",,1,"Not a fan. The color is great but theres virtually no coverage and its extremely liquidy. Trying to blend it out just takes all of the product away. I usually love Covergirl products, but this is a huge no."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Inexpensive but effective,"April 30, 2021",,5,This is a great everyday concealer. It doesn't feel heavy or look cakey on your face. I love wearing this for no makeup makeup looks. The price is a STEAL!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Average Coverage compared to other Cover girl products,"December 1, 2019",630 Deep/Dark,4,"The foundation is definitely more liquidy and does not have a lot of coverage. It almost more like a liquid color correcter and evener than a foundation. If you like more of a natural and dewy finish, then this is a great foundation. If you are looking for a bit more of a fuller coverage than this is not so great for that."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Blends nicely,"December 5, 2020",,5,This is nice powder.  It really helps control shine and blends in nicely without looking cakey.  It is lightweight and doesn’t have a strong scent.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not very thick,"October 16, 2020",,3,I was hoping that this covered more of the dark circles under my eyes but it is more oily that I anticipated. The coverage was alright but it didn't last all day. I think if you were to set it with powder that it might work better than it did for me.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good coverage,"September 26, 2020",,5,This concealer goes on smoothly and easily with good coverage for under eyes when you aren't sleeping. It lasted all day with perfect coverage but washed right off at the end of the day. It left my skin feeling fresh and hydrated so it's non drying too.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice powder that matched my skin tone,"November 21, 2020",,5,This powder works very well. It match my skin tone based on the description and comes very well packaged. It is pleasant and easy to use and carry.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,too sheer.,"October 2, 2020",,2,I didn't liked because I don't have dark circles but this concealer is way too sheer and it dries fast. There are better concealers on the market.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great concealer!,"October 8, 2020",,5,"I was skeptical about using a low price brand concealer. However, I was happy to see that this works to cover my eye bags just as much as the expensive brands. I chose light and it blended perfectly in my skin. I am asian with medium light skin color fyi."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good Coverage,"October 24, 2020",,4,"This powder has good coverage, its lightweight and it does even skin tone.  The powder does cut shine and feels comfortable on your skin.  Only problem - Hard to get the correct shade online."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very Nice Powder,"January 5, 2021",,5,"Went on very creamy.  I am able to use just some coverup, with the powder over.  The color is very natural looking, not chalky.  Really like it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Light, great staying power","February 27, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,5,"I have used Cover Girl for decades. I absolutely love this base. It feels incredibly light and has serious staying power. The number was unfamiliar and looked on the dark side, but it went on beautifully and looks awesome. I live in south Texas so a base that doesn't run in the heat is imperative."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very natural medium coverage.,"December 11, 2019",530 Fair/Light,5,This Cover Girl Clean Fresh foundation in tge 530 fair/light blends in nicely with my skin. It provides medium coverage (not too heavy and not too light). I love that it feels hydrating and leaves your skin looking brighter and a little dewy - but not shiny. I think the price is fair too. I highly recommend this foundation!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pretty decent,"October 5, 2020",,4,"This is definitely a light weight concealer. So far it seems to work pretty good. It doesnt have a lot of coverage which is fine with me. But its ""longevity"" isn't really there. With the help of setting spray it does last slightly longer though."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice quality!!,"October 7, 2020",,5,"10/07/2020Unfortunately it was a bit dark for my wife's skin, so we can not judge this in terms of tone.However, the quality of the powder feels great, and the case is very neat!I think we wil keep looking for the correct tone!!5/5!"

I even bought my friend this and she loves it.Will def purchase again. Highly recommended."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,A bit thick,"July 2, 2021",,3,"I wouldn't use this as a foundation because it was too thick for me. If you like a thick foundation, this may work for you. Conceals well."

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light concealer,"January 8, 2021",,4,This is a light concealer and works fairly well but is more for light discolorations. It might be best for younger users rather than older with a need for a heavier coverup.  It has a good texture and applies evenly.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice light coverage...,"January 26, 2020",540 Light,4,"I like this foundation for days that I want very light coverage, but I'm not a fan of the subtle glow.  It is okay after I apply a bit of loose powder though.  It's not sticky, and applies smoothly.  I would consider it a tinted moisturizer.  I'm prone to breakouts, and this didn't trigger any."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great powder & accompanying mirror,"October 5, 2020",,3,"I prefer the skin toned powders, since I don't use foundation everyday.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,So a different approach . . .,"December 3, 2019",590 Tan/Rich,4,"It's smooth and light, I like this.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light Coverage,"September 30, 2020",,4,"This concealer was not what I expected. The color was great and blended pretty well for the most part, but it is very thin and light coverage. You will need to apply it a couple times to conceal anything."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Works well to conceal my dark circles,"September 19, 2020",,5,"I like how easy this concealer is to blend into my dark spots and circles under my eyes.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Worked well,"December 29, 2019",580 Tan,4,I like Covergirl products and think  this is a good foundation.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Applies Well & Great Texture,"January 4, 2020",580 Tan,4,"Unfortunately, I ordered a color that is way too dark for my skin— it looked much lighter in the photo of the colors. It does go on smoothly and I do like the texture."

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Impressed,"April 10, 2020",520 Fair,5,Love this foundation. It looks like skin and is dewy but doesn’t transfer. Good stuff!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Great product! Just not for me, unfortunately.","March 21, 2020",520 Fair,4,"**I have rather yellow/warm undertones to my skin, have oily skin, and bought 520 FAIR**I'm pretty sure it's just not the color for me, but overall it's not a bad product if it's the right color for you! I'll start with just the product basics and then go over my personal wear of it.The foundation is very light and sheer and offers a nice, subtle dewy effect when applied. It isn't thick, doesn't have a strong scent, and comes in a cute little bottle about the size of my hand, just a little smaller. It's quite moisturizing (personally won't advise for oily prone skin, will detail below), and offers longer lasting wear than I've gotten out of other powders and liquid foundations (all without a primer/setting spray, including this one). Overall it seems like a good product for it's price! It just wasn't for me.As I mentioned, I have rather yellowy/warm undertones to my skin. I don't have pinker/cooler undertones to my skin. Applying this with a VERY, VERY sheer coat to my hand and face was okay and matched seemingly perfectly!, though it clearly didn't offer ANY type of coverage that way. One more light coat and it proved to be too grey/whitening. Though it matches my skintone/lightness, it doesn't match my undertone at all, and looks extremely unflattering lol. I also have very oily skin, and my skin oils up within about 8 hours of washing. This creates a weird build up and unflattering appearance to the foundation when the oil builds (didn't use a primer/setting spray btw, don't know how it will change with those added).If you have oily skin, and if you're warmer/more yellow undertoned like I am, the 520 Fair might not be for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't see any other reason not to buy this foundation. It's good for it's price!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"It’s ok, but has some flaws. Good for occasional use. Not every day wear.","May 20, 2020",510 Porcelain,3,"It’s lightweight, and the color is fine, but I’ve noticed when I apply it, there’s these little particles that seem to appear from nowhere, like I applied the foundation after it dried. But it’s easy enough to wipe off with a blender. I have combination skin and while it doesn’t bother my normal or greasy areas of the face, if I miss a spot on my forehead when I’m taking it off it makes my forehead super dry and flaky, and I get these big patches of dry skin. I don’t wear foundation regularly, mostly just concealer, so this isn’t bad for every once in a while use, but not what I would use for every day wear."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Eh,"January 16, 2021",520 Fair,3,"I love the no makeup look, as I don't wear makeup unless absolutely necessary. With the video conferencing, it's important to even out face coloring in important meetings. I usually take a little base and mix it with my face lotion. I thought this one would be a one-step solution. However, you have to put a lot on to match the coverage of a very small amount of base. And any that I put on seems to sit on the surface, and you can see it on your face. Lastly, the smell is weird--like clay or something, and it sticks around for a while."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice if you Like Light Coverage,"June 17, 2020",520 Fair,4,"My great niece by marriage loves this foundation, so thought I would try it.  It is a nice foundation for summer when you want a very light coverage.  But it does not cover any imperfections, blemishes, scars, freckles, redness, and etc. on your skin.  Very light sheer coverage.  It also has a very dewy with a bit of a shine after applying.I use it when I am just want a bit of make up on, but for a good coverage make up, this is not for me.  I will not be buying it again."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Bad,"June 23, 2020",510 Porcelain,1,its so oily it wipes right off and gives zero coverage. If i could give no stars I would. Its not even moisturizing.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Just no...hard pass,"May 30, 2020",520 Fair,2,"This is some of the worst foundation I have ever used.  I was a huge fan of the Covergirl Healthy Elixir and heard this replaced that product.  Not even close.  There are strange white balls that show on the skin, it doesn't blend well and sits oddly on the skin.  I have only tried it twice and hated it both times.  I haven't tried messing with different primers under it or no primer at all.  I have normal skin and this is a hard pass for me."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Applies cakey,"February 13, 2020",520 Fair,1,I was excited to try this and was disappointed. It applies cakey and dry. Not fresh as described. I looked extra pale and I'm already really white. I'd recommend going a couple shades darker than you'd think. I even used a new fancy sponge.....
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I really wanted to love this...,"March 27, 2020",580 Tan,2,"My time wearing this, I loved it. The coverage was light but just enough for me. It’s moisturizing without leaving my skin oily. I was about to leave a 5 star review after the first try. However, I decided to try it again. Second time trying it is when I found the little balls.. they wouldn’t dissolve so I have to pick them out. Because of this, I do not recommend this product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Fantastic,"July 10, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,5,Daughter's fave foundation. She has contact dermatitis and some foundations leave a rash around her mouth area. This foundation does not do that to her and she loves how it looks and feels on her skin and she loves the ingredients being skin healthy
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Yuck! Not for me! Dry as a bone!!!,"January 1, 2022",560 Medium,1,"First of all it is so dry it feels like you've put a clay mask on. If you have super oily skin, it would be great for you. Secondly, it is too sheer and does not cover. Third, it feels nasty on the skin. I don't like it. Not for me."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pros > Cons,"July 9, 2020",510 Porcelain,5,"Definitely light coverage and doesn’t stay super well through sweat. It’s moisturizing and the shade actually matches my super pale complexion (which is tricky). Overall, a good product if you’re looking for a low-maintenance, natural look.p"

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Finally, a good talc-free powder at the drugstore","September 30, 2020",,4,"I was very excited to read about the release of CoverGirl's Clean Fresh Pressed Powder. I love affordable beauty products but my skin is quite sensitive to talc, so I'm really happy to see CoverGirl offer a reasonably large (considering this is the drugstore) selection of talc-free pressed powders.For me, one star was docked for packaging. I usually don't care at all because it's usually not an inherent issue of the product. However, CoverGirl has this wacky plastic insert *in* the compact that's attached to the outer packaging. It necessarily gets ripped out along with the entire outer packaging, which left some nicks in the powder itself. A pretty janky powder puff is included, except it's much worse quality than what you can grab at any dollar store. The texture is rough and patchy and I would not recommend using it all -- frankly, a tissue or napkin would perform better.As for the powder itself, I picked out the Medium shade to try out as a bronzer. I really like how smoothly the product applies with a generic brush. It's not overly pigmented, which speaks well to it being a setting powder after all, and lasts all day. There was a bit of powder kick back when I used it for the first time but it hasn't happened since, so I assume that was the fault of the packaging. So far, I love the quality! The Medium shade is going to replace my high-end bronzers and I will definitely be back to purchase the translucent pressed powder for travel.In terms of inclusivity -- I think this line does ok, and definitely better than what CoverGirl has done in the past. There still isn't a tinted shade fair enough for my skin tone, but I'm perfectly satisfied with CoverGirl finally offering an untinted translucent powder option instead."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice compact; makeup is okay (settles into lines a bit),"September 26, 2020",,4,"It has been awhile since I've had a pressed powder compact--I am over 35 and tend to avoid powders like this because they can age me, but it has been a very humid year here in the northeast so oil and sweat have coupled to leave me with a very shiny t-zone that even blotting papers won't tame. This powder is fairly light--it doesn't have a mask-like look, and it offers some coverage without caking (as long as I don't use it too often). It's also great when I'm in a hurry because a little moisturizer, mascara and a quick pat of this evens out redness and shine enough that (when coupled with my mask) I look pulled together, even though I've gotten ready at red lights (no need for lipstick/contour/nose concealer is the one blessing I'm grateful for in this mask situation😁).I like the pretty pink compact and just having a mirror in my purse. It smells a bit odd to me...like baby powder maybe? IDK, but it's not too strong (seems unnecessary though). I definitely have to keep the powder away from my under-eye and laugh-line areas because it does settle into those fine lines, but otherwise it wears well and doesn't oxidize into anything orange. I ordered the fair, and it's perfect for my pale skin with pink/blue undertones. It blends very well. If it helps with shades, I wear Fairly Light in Bare Minerals (my normal powder), and I have been pairing this powder with my normal application of Purlisse BB Cream in Light; this powder blends perfectly with that cream (the BM is a smidge darker).I like this as far as drugstore pressed powders go; I can't say I will use it as my first choice in daily wear, but it's great to have on hand for quick touch-ups, and I'm happy that it blends so well with my regular routine. I would buy it again, but I know this will last me ages as I don't use a lot (but the cute compact and mirror are great, and it's very inexpensive)."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Can use more layers if needed,"September 21, 2020",,5,"This concealer comes in 14 different shades.The one I received is medium to light.It is a light weight concealer that you can build upwith more layers if you need to depending on what you are tryingto cover up, blemishes, redness, etc.It does cover blemishes, dark spots and sun spots, I tried it on all.Doesn’t crack as some do with building it up with more layers.I have had that happen before.Put a thick spot so you can see the consistency of the product.I put three layers on.It is vegan and more importantly to me cruelty free, not testedon animals.It has coconut milk and aloe in it.Feels nourishing to my skin.It doesn’t have any thing in there that will clog your pores so it shouldnot cause any break outs or comedones  (black or white heads).No talc, formaldehyde, parabens, sulfates, phthalates.It has a nice soft finish and look.Feels hydrating to the touch.Went on smoothly, not lumpy or sticky feeling.You put it on with soft sponge on the end of the applicator wand ifyou need more coverage dip your wand in the tube again.I would apply to a freshly washed face as not to contaminate your tube.Mine did not come in a package just the tube.I have enclosed pictures so you can make a informed decision based on yourpersonal needs.Yes I would recommend this product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,This is a great foundation!,"August 3, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,5,"I like this foundation.  I'm a middle aged black woman with a tan skin tone, so I thought that this might be the right foundation for me and I am pleased to say that I was right.  I am happy to say that I don't need a foundation with  full coverage at my age.  My main problem is dark areas under my eyes and a slightly uneven complexion.  I still have to use a concealer for my darkest areas, but this foundation is perfect for my overall coverage.  It is a light coverage that can be intensified with an extra layer.  I like being able to choose between a light coverage for general wear and a fuller coverage when I want a more ""made up"" look.In my opinion this foundation has no negatives.  It dries fast and blends in with my skin without a lot of work.  It doesn't require any special applicators.  You can even apply it with your fingers.  It blends with concealers and other contouring colors flawlessly.  I love the container.  I usually get foundations in glass bottles that are messy to dispense.  The container that this is in allows you to squeeze out the precise amount that you need without making a mess.  I never knew how helpful that feature is before I used this.  I'm sure that will make it easier to use all of it.I really like this foundation.  I appreciate Covergirl offering foundations with a color range for women of color.  I would recommend this foundation to anyone."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for my 31 year old skin.,"January 20, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,3,"I usually love covergirl foundations. This was a complete miss for me. The things that are intriguing about this foundation is it is100% vegan. Also the Ingredients of aloe and coconut milk really made me excited about this product.The color I received through the vine program is more my summer color, so I am not rating this based on that. This foundation is RUNNY, almost like water. It claims to be light coverage. I have tinted moisturizer that provides more coverage than this stuff. It goes on okay, but that’s mainly to the watery consistency. I feel like this product sits on my skin and doesn’t Blend well. I feel more chalky than dewy. I a 31 with normal skin, a little oily in the t zone, and fine lines are creeping up on me. This foundation does not work for me, but maybe some in high school."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Was able to go 4 hours before my face looked shiny with this pressed powder,"January 4, 2021",,4,"I applied the pressed powder and my face looked a bit dry and you could see the powder sitting on the hairs on my face. After a little bit, I noticed that as my pores naturally created its own oils, that the powder slowly absorbed and it looked more natural after that. Took about 4 hours before my face looked a tad shiny and I had to blot. The medium shade was a good match for my skin tone but it was tad on the yellow side. A little of this powder goes a long way though. As I was trying to make sure I got good coverage, I went over a couple spots and this powder will build upon previous areas and when I wasn't careful about it, it would look a bit cakey."

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,A nice basic powder,"September 30, 2020",,4,"I have tried some of the other CoverGirl powders, as well as other brands, and decided to give this a try. Here are my impressions:This went on as you'd expect a powder would and I was pleased that this had a mirror attached to it. Not all powders do and it's nice to have a mirror to look in as you're applying. It's relatively sheer but could cover blemishes and spots , as well as even out tone. I will warn you, however, that you will want to check your application as it's easy to accidentally put a bit too much on. That's pretty par for the course with powder, though. I also want to warn users that you will absolutely need to moisturize your face before using this. If you have any dry flakes on your face this will just enhance them. Again, that's kind of to be expected with powder but it's always good to remind people since it's easy to forget when you're on the go. One day there will be an easy, mess free way to have a bit of moisturizer/sunblock and a compact powder in one easy container. One day.Still, this is a pretty good product and one I absolutely see myself buying on my own in the future."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Cleaner ingredients and a cleaner fresher face!,"September 29, 2020",,5,"As my skin ages I find I am moving away from most powders as they tend to settle in my wrinkles and dry cheek patches, but with an oily t-zone, I feel I need something to absorb oil and keep my face looking fresh. This Covergirl Clean Fresh Pressed Powder fills that need for me. I am happy with the lack of parabens and talc, it's nice to see a mainstream makeup company make the move to better ingredients. The tapioca absorbs oil in my t-zone, while the aloe keeps my cheeks from getting flaky. I wore the powder all day, it stayed nice and did not break down or settle in my creases and my face still looked clean and fresh at the end of the day. All in all, I am pleased."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Buildable lightweight coverage, non-drying, but smells funky. Good for sensitive dry skin","June 25, 2020",580 Tan,4,"I like this Covergirl Skin Milk, but it’s not my go to. I use the Tan on my pale face for a temporary fake bake glow that looks natural and dewy but not greasy. Great for sensitive, oily, and -especially- dry skin. VERY light coverage but can build up to almost medium. Non-drying, even on my super dry patches it doesn’t cake.The formula has a chalky feel though and, while it IS moisturizing, I’d still recommend a more moisturizing primer/lotion for very dry skin. Doesn’t last long and transfers rather easy on its own. It also smells terrible! I can’t describe it but it isn’t pleasant. Almost like chalk, which is how it feels on your fingers. Be careful pressing the tube, too much goo will come out too fast.It does blurs imperfections and pores and covers blemishes fairly well. In my photos I built it up on a super bright weird red spot that’s always been on my hand. Doesn’t look like much, but on “regular” less bright, red shaded or discolored areas it should cover better.If you don’t like wearing or looking like you wear a ton of makeup this is great for a quick cover to give your face nice glistening color. Perfect for wearing over another favorite foundation that may be too matte, or use to contour. I recommend giving it a try."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Take Care of Your Skin with Covergirl,"December 9, 2019",510 Porcelain,4,"Skin care is important for everyone, but women seem to get involved in the skin care routine more than men. Manufacturers have responded with an abundance of skin care products and Covergirl is one of the best-known names for skin care and cosmetics. Given Covergirl’s penchant for quality, I had no problem giving Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk a try.My wife took to this product quickly. She says it provides good coverage. She likes the hydrating qualities and the luminous aspects. She says it works as expected and confirms her longstanding confidence in this brand. Just a small amount is all it takes and the results are quickly noticeable, both to the eyes and to the touch.This product is meant as a liquid foundation and my wife says that the best way to use it is to apply it to the darker areas of your skin first, allowing it to bake- so to speak- before then applying it all over. She says this provides the best results and the most even skin tone overall.Skin care is important and Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk is a good means to soft, moisturized, clearer skin. It’s another good product from one of the most trusted names in skin care and one that earns an easy recommendation."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Buildable, thin classic style foundation. Free from some nasty chemicals.","December 5, 2019",540 Light,5,"I really like this- working into my new everyday routine- but not a best ever type of a reaction. I’m in between on if I would repurchase once it’s used up.This is an easy to apply product that I’m mostly using as a go to to just smear a little all over face and go.It has a slightly watery and opaque look and feel of a standard, classic face foundation. I was surprised by this because they made it sound like more of a bb cream with all of the “skin milk”, coconut milk, and aloe references. I was expecting something thicker from the description. I didn’t notice or feel any difference in my skin hydration feel from this product. In fact it looked a little dry when on, like I should have used this along with some thicker and dewy tinted moisturizer. I think that it’s good as a buildable face product in that I’m going to use with a combination of face products until I get the hydration and coverage I want.I have a pale but slightly ruddy complexion and I liked the way this smoothed out the look of my face pretty well with just one layer.I love that it’s free from parabens (good if you are pregnant) and a bunch of other nasty stuff nobody wants in their makeup. So happy to see cover girl embrace the cleaner makeup trend and make the labels clear on what’s not in it in case you are scanning for things like parabens in your stuff and want to know if it’s free from it.Overall I’d recommend it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Work on your shade selection,"April 16, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,3,"It's crazy to see that a brand that used to have Queen Latifah's ahead-of-its-time inclusive line has such a poor range years later. Black skin colors are far too complex for such limits. The shade I got is not quite right in undertone OR overtone but was the closest in the range; the next shade up is actually lighter in tone and the shade after that looks like a cocoa brown when I'm a golden tanned olive. The shade I got makes my face look a little ashy; it's one of those shades I would describe as ""eh, I can work with it"".As for the performance after tweaking it with other products, it works well as a light foundation with a blurring effect. I have oily skin but didn't need to set it. It didn't crease or separate on my face. I wish it was transfer resistant, and I feel like it should have spf but it's a nice option for those who want a light foundation with no spf.If you can find your shade, I'd give it a try."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk-Shade Medium Tan- Healthy looking skin with a dewy finish,"January 14, 2020",570 Medium/Tan,4,"I am passionate about skincare and wear foundation daily.  I ordered Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk in the shade Medium/Tan. I usually wear natural, medium, or neutral foundations.  I have been told by makeup professionals that my skin color is very versatile and that these shades work best.  If I am tan I usually wear something just a touch darker.  I wear a sunless tanner on my body frequently.  I found that this shade blends well with my skin.  It does have a dewy finish that feels like I recently put cream on my face. I find that it works best without finishing powder or just very lightly dusted. This is a nice choice for someone looking for balanced coverage and hydration.  I have not found granules in this foundation. This foundation is returnable.  It repels water and does not rinse off with just water easily. This foundation does not have an SPF which is really important to me in a foundation.  I always apply an SPF under my foundation but also appreciate it when it is built-in. It would also be nice if it had a hint of illumination. I do like this foundation and would order again.Pros-Dewy and hydrated feelingEasy to blendHas not been cakey or flakeyIt makes my skin look naturally balanced and healthyIt feels really niceCons-Lacks an SPF1 fluid oz- I like a larger foundation size"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Natural coverage,"August 2, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,5,"Got this because I wanted to try a new foundation that didn’t look cakey. This is absolutely beautiful. The consistency is on the water side, it’s not thick at all. The scent is fresh. The amount is 1 oz and will last a long time for me because I use foundation on special occasions, not everyday wear.The coverage is wonderful. I squeezed the product directly on my skin and blended it out with a wet sponge. It did not take a lot of product at all to cover my entire face. As you can see, the finished product is a dewy look which is what I’ve been looking for.This is great for older women who still want coverage for age spots and blemishes but still want to look natural. I set this foundation with powder and for the entire face my foundation stayed in place. Been using it since and am in love.For the price, I definitely recommend this because it exceeded my expectations. Definitely a quality product!! Will be buying more when I run out!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Feels light, provides nice coverage with good oil control.","October 2, 2020",,4,Covergirl clean fresh pressed powder works beautifully ☺️ I really love that this powder is talc free. I also love that it feels light but provides nice coverage and good oil control without feeling cakey. The color is true to what you would normally buy. I've been using a different brand of pressed powder but I ordered the same shade number/name as I have with them and It was perfect. The foam puff for application is a little thin but works remarkably well. It stores on top of the powder between the pressed powder and the lid. My previous container had a separate hinged bottom that stored the sponge but it also makes the compact thicker And I really like the slimmer design of this compact which also has mirror in the lid.  I believe I may have found a new favorite powder!
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good Lightweight Foundation - Average Drugstore Quality,"January 1, 2020",560 Medium,3,"The Covergirl Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation is a good average quality drugstore foundation.  This foundation offers lightweight coverage and is suitable for all skin types.  I have combination skin and the foundation went on smoothly, helped lightly even out my skin tone without caking on, and hid lighter blemishes just fine.  I did need to use this foundation with a primer as it did seem to sink into winkles when used solo.  While the foundation worked well for short term use, I found that the foundation wore out by the end of the day.  The staying power of the foundation isn’t all that good, and there are comparable foundations that cost just as much but lasted much longer.  Overall, this is a decent foundation to use if you’re looking for light coverage, but there are other options out there that last a lot longer."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Sheer but chalky,"July 30, 2020",620 Deep,3,"I'm a brand loyalist but decided to step outside of my comfort zone and try something different as I needed a lightweight foundation. This product seemed to offer everything that I was looking for and more. I decided to wear it to a recent trip to an amusement park. What I loved was his light it is. It's light enough not to clog your pores but enough coverage to see that there is something on your face. You can definitely pull off the no makeup-makeup look. What I didn't like is how it left my face feeling and looking chalky. In quite a few photos, close up photos, it's  pretty noticeable but in pictures taken further away, you can't tell. If I can figure out what's causing the chalk look and resolve that issue, this will be my be everyday foundation used."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,BETTER THAN EXPECTED!,"December 29, 2019",580 Tan,5,"Received through Vine for an honest review.  I am surprised this is Cover Girl.  It's made more like Neutrogena.  It's lightweight and goes on so smoothly and blends VERY WELL! The smell has a nice clean smell.  I prefer a powder foundation but this goes on so well, evenly and easy to work with.  Works VERY well with other brand blushes, shadows, etc., not all mix.  Cover Girl has come a long way since I used it in high school.  Doesn't oxidize or turn orangish.  It's just really nice foundation with nice coverage.  I would most likely purchase this in a bind if I couldn't find my powder foundation. That's saying a lot!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,3-1/2 Stars. OK Formula. Horrible Puff,"September 30, 2020",,4,"This review is for the Clean Fresh Pressed Powder Compact.The compact is a standard size compact with a flip top lid. The puff is a foam puff that is hard to grip and hard to smooth over one's face.The powder is translucent and is easy to apply. The powder doesn't seem to end up congregating in fine wrinkles.  The powder formula contains both drying and some moisture retention ingredients, but not super moisturizing ingredients like shea butter or coconut oil, so for me, great for the T zone, but I need additional moisturizer prior to applying this powder.Note that this powder also contains Titanium Dioxide, an ingredient that could make your face look whiter in pictures taken with a flash."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very light coverage with a dewy finish,"December 11, 2019",530 Fair/Light,5,"This claims to be for light coverage, and it certainly is.  It smooths on nicely without creating a fake or heavy look at all. I would say the effect is ""dewy"" (for lack of a better word) because my nose was actually shiny after putting it on. If you want to get rid of any shine, you'll need to apply powder after this. It provides a measure of smoothness without completely evening out skin tone. You could still see the ruddiness of my cheeks after I put this on, but it did cover up my one age spot.  I think this is a little bit lighter than I need at age 47, but a younger person who just wants a little bit of even color (without creating a flawless but heavier base) might really like this.  I thought the chart for choosing the correct color really worked, because the color I selected works perfectly for me."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Might be better for normal-oily skin.,"October 6, 2020",,3,"If you have normal skin you might give this 4 stars. I unfortunately have very dry skin and dry patches. There hasn't been a single concealer that I've tested that worked for me. It always settles in my fine lines and patches no matter how much I moisturize beforehand.But I should say that this didn't settle TOO much. It wasn't perfect but it was acceptable. The coverage is good, it was able to hide old scars and pigmentation on my face.This is just my opinion because my skin is very different. But if you have normal skin and you don't have any issues with concealer this will work great for you because the ingredients seem clean and it does do the job well."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It's ok,"October 28, 2020",,3,"Covergirl is typically my favorite when it comes to concealer, I've bought the high end department store types, and the bargain drugstore types, but I always return to my covergirl concealer. Except this one. Maybe I got a bad tube, but the formula is almost pasty, it doesn't blend very well, and I have to start with very light dots, blend, light dots, blend, etc. until I get the coverage I need. I'm used to dabbing a bit on, blending, being done. As someone who hits a snooze button twelve times and then hauls through a morning routing, I don't have time for this one. I'll be going back to my regular tube. That said, if you have the time and want buildable coverage, this could be for you."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light coverage. Cruelty free!,"January 6, 2020",550 Light/Medium,4,"First and foremost cruelty free which is a huge plus in my book. Along with being cruelty free it’s 100% vegan! You have to be aware of what you’re putting on your face and knowing this is vegan and cruelty free is amazing.The coverage is very light. I personally don’t need heavy coverage but I almost felt at times it was too light (hence one star off). It is described as light and I almost feel it’s like a CC cream. Just adds a little tint to help blend unevenness and moisturize. I also feel the product could have had some spf to make it even better... but also a lot of spf contains non vegan ingredients so that’s hard to do.Overall it’s a good lightly tinted moisturizer. Good for those who don’t need a lot, but like a good price and clean product!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lighter than the foundation,"September 19, 2020",,5,"I've never tried concealer before and wasn't sure the difference between the concealer and foundation. I learned concealer should be applied before foundation. I don't really want to spend too much time applying each product, so I want to pick one.Foundation to me is a little bit too thick. I tried the concealer and I prefer the lighter feeling on my face. The color first appeared a little bit more orange than my skin tone, but eventually it blends in well. The concealer removes some fine lines, but it looks so much more natural than the foundation, which makes me look so fake.  THe concealer does not dry my skin. It feels comfortable and light all day. Totally love it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,love the finish!,"January 5, 2020",580 Tan,5,"i usually don't like how my skin looks with foundation because i have huge pores, liquid full coverage foundations makes me look like a cakey mess. it looks horrible!this is a good one for me. it is not full coverage, light to medium, more on light coverage which makes it look natural on the skin. it doesn't emphasize my pores or my smile lines. i don't mind the light coverage because it evens out my skin tone. it is super light weight, i don't feel like i have anything on and i don't feel sticky.it is runny in consistency and it has a certain smell that reminds of something that didn't dry too well -- very faint stinky smell to me. but it goes away. i don't powder too much because i am liking the dewy look."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for me,"October 10, 2020",,3,"I like the applicator for this concealer. The wand is just the right length. Not too long (where you lose control) but not too short either, It has a nice divot end to it. There is no discernible scent. I have extremely sensitive facial skin and this product gave me no problems. These are the positives.I used this for dark circles under my eyes (I currently use another brand). While I prefer the applicator on this product, the concealer itself did not work for me. It has a slight shine to it which just looks weird under the eyes. I don't want to draw attention to that area, that's the point!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Incredibly misleading name regarding shade,"December 22, 2019",530 Fair/Light,3,"You would think ""Fresh Skin Milk Fair/Light"" would be a milk-white color for poor saps like me who are so pale that their wrists literally reflect sunlight onto the roof of their car while driving (true story). But no. You would also think Fair/Light implies a pale, warm color. Again, no.This is actually more of a Fair/Medium. I made my mom try it, who is about three shades darker than me, and it was perfect on her, whereas on me, it had a yellowish/orange undertone that looked horrible with my pink skintone and was much too dark. It feels very nice on and I'm sure it's a great product, but this is nowhere near as light as you would think it would be, and that's very important to know when shopping online."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Using for contour @69 :),"February 7, 2021",,5,"Even at 69 we still care about creating contoured face :).  I like this brand for so many reasons..No animal testing, no un necessary additions that are detrimental to my skin, environment.. Now, I got a darker color because I wanted a good contrast that I could blend in and this is perfect.  The powder it's self is tightly compressed and you only need very very little to create a contrast.  Blends really well, just being careful with amount adding just the very edge of sponge to powder & then blend.  This is silky like it has moistness in it, love it"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Very lightweight, light coverage foundation","January 13, 2020",530 Fair/Light,4,"This I would consider more to be a tinted moisturizer than a full foundation. It doesn't have any SPF in it, so people who are sensitive to that might want to try this. If you need more coverage, you might need a primer that provides that or have a good concealer since this gives you very little coverage. I wasn't able to conceal any of my dark circles under my eyes or my acne redness. This was able to cover my pores a bit.The scent is a sweet, coconut cookie sort of scent which isn't too overwhelming.Overall, this is a nice lightweight foundation without SPF offering light coverage and a dewy finish."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Not for me.,"September 30, 2020",,3,"I have used pressed powders before and I've had this happen on occasion. This gives my medium brown complexion a dusty, chalky look. It stood out in my pores, making them look more than obvious. If I do use it, I have to pat and pat and pat it down with a tissue or something afterwards. That's why I have it three stars, because once I tame the ghostly look my skin looks like free and filtered. But you really shouldn't have to go through all that, I don't think. If you find a shade good for your complexion, you might love it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Are you looking for dewy, light coverage?","December 2, 2019",540 Light,5,"Purchased in 540 light.This product is vegan, light coverage that leaves skin with a dewy glow that is not sparkly.There is zero glitter in this product.  It blends easily and the “dewy” aspect is muted and very pretty.It’s not thick, a light lotion consistency that your skin will easily absorb without feeling greasy at all.That being said, the coverage is pretty sheer as well, so it’s perfect for people who do not want a heavy look.This color, 540 light, blends into my fair-neutral skin perfectly.  It has a neutral base that is neither warm nor cool—perfect match on me. (Blonde hair green eyes)Happy with this product, just wish it came in a bigger tube. :)"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Love this! So soft and pretty!,"August 2, 2020",620 Deep,5,"In the photo, I’m wearing this foundation just on my cheek and as you can see, my skin looks mice and smooth but the color blend is PERFECT. It doesn’t even feel like I have anything on, which is a huuuge thing for me. I can’t stand foundation normally, because it just feels like a layer on my face, but this literally just feels like a moisturizer and it leaves such a soft and beautiful look to the skin! This is perfect for summer for when I want to wear a little makeup, and have a more refined look."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good,"March 7, 2020",510 Porcelain,4,"I'm super picky about foundation and can't stand anything heavy on my face. I typically wear UD Naked Skin, for reference. This is a great substitute foundation for basic wear, though. It's creamy and applies very easily, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. If I'm being picky, I'd say I'm not a huge fan of the smell when I first apply it, but it doesn't last long. Overall, this is a great basic foundation. Try it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Better than expected!,"April 15, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,4,I received this item through the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review.I will post pictures when the feature is open again.This was a bit dark for my current face skin tone - I don't do a lot of online ordering of makeup so matching tone is hard. But I'm happy with the coverage!It's very dewy and goes on easily. It leaves my skin not feeling dried out. It also seems fairly easy to blend! It leaves my skin feeling fresh and has nice low lights to it.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Tinted Moisturizer,"December 5, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,"The packaging on this says foundation on the back, but really what this is is a tinted moisturizer. It does not cover anything, it did help even out the redness in my skin tone just a little.That being said- I absolutely love it as a lightweight tinted moisturizer. It doesn’t look like I’m wearing any makeup at all. It doesn’t feel like I’m wearing any makeup at all. There is a light scent that goes away after awhile.  It keeps my skin soft and does not seem to be clogging my pores at all. I have been using it daily since I received it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice coverage and helps reduce shine,"September 16, 2020",,5,"Overall I am happy with this product. It has a nice coverage, doesn’t feel heavy on my skin and in a pinch helps to reduce shine on my face without making me look like a ghost. Perfect for last minute touch ups before a zoom call or just a half way through the day type thing. I keep mine on my desk so it’s readily available when I need it.Only thing I don’t love is the applicator itself. Just isn’t as high a quality as I’m used to but it works fine."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I use it on my cheeks,"December 12, 2019",600 Rich,5,"My skin is a light color and is very dry. I use this COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Skin Milk on my cheeks after I've applied my lighter-colored foundation and before I add any blush. This skin milk is so moisturizing it gives my cheeks the extra dose of moisture they need. I would've thought the color ""Rich"" would be too dark, but because it applies so sheer, it is great to add a wash of smooth color to my cheeks. If I wanted more color density, I could apply a second layer, but that's not what I want. I am thrilled with this terrific ""Milk."""
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Sheer, Yet Complete Coverage of Dark Circles ...","October 1, 2020",,5,"I love ""COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Hydrating Concealer, Fair"" for its ability to hide those under-eye circles and for its sheer, but complete coverage.  I wear a porcelain foundation, so chose the ""Fair"" color of this concealer.  Used alone, the color was a bit too light, but with a full ""face"", the color was perfect.  If you plan to wear this concealer without other foundation, I recommend choosing a slightly darker color than you think you need."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very sheer,"October 11, 2020",,3,"This concealer was a bit of a disappointment. It doesn’t go on smoothly and it’s way too sheer to be concealer.I tried using it with primer and without, but it just didn’t work well. It’s almost like it didn’t want to stick to my skin. It just slid around and did,t cover anything.I guess if you’re looking for minimal coverage with your makeup and don’t really need to conceal anything, then this would be your product."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice lightweight and moisturizing make-up,"December 27, 2019",550 Light/Medium,5,"This liquid make-up is for very light coverage, which I like because I don't like to wear a ton of make-up. If you need heavier coverage, this is not for you. However, I recommend this if you don't mind applying a couple of coats. It really evens out skin tone nicely and feels really nice on the skin as it has moisturizing qualities and leaves your skin feeling refreshed after application. It goes on smoothly with a sponge applicator. Even with two coats on, it still feels very lightweight and comfortable."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great under eye coverage Cruelty Free,"October 1, 2020",,5,"Ever since Cover Girl announced that it no longer tests its products on animals, I have become a big fan. This under eye concealer is liquid and comes in a tube with a sponges applicator. I apply a few dots and then spread it under my eyes with my fingertip. It gets rid of any dark circles or under-eye discoloration. It lasts all day. I don't wear foundation so this is a perfect fit for my makeup routine. I use the fair to light shade and it is a perfect match to my skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Pretty Smooth Coverage . . . .,"December 17, 2019",580 Tan,4,"Tan, the color I received to test out, was way too dark for my skin; so, I mixed in some Olay Luminous Miracle Boost Concentrate; but even that couldn't lighten it up enough. Oh well. The foundation goes on smooth, although not as smooth as my regular foundation, but my regular one costs a whole lot more.  I may very well try out this foundation in a lighter shade in the future, because it's really not bad at all.  It's provides lightweight coverage, but not as lightweight as a BB cream. If it has a scent, I didn't detect it. I've used CC foundations on and off for decades."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Allergic reaction / rash,"November 5, 2020",550 Light/Medium,2,I really wanted to love this product.  I chose it in an effort to remove chemicals from my skincare products.  Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to the skin milk foundation and the pressed powder.  Otherwise it felt ok on my skin and the coverage was average.  If it hadn't given me a rash I would have continued to use it.  I would love to know if this happened to anyone else and find out which ingredient to avoid in the future.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very Light Coverage,"December 20, 2019",520 Fair,3,"This makeup provides very light coverage. As a person who is super pale, fair is a color that matched my skin tone quite well. This product is really moisturizing, however, I did put it on over moisturizer. It did not dry my skin out. I applied it using a beauty blender. I found that it goes on super light and so I had to put on about two layers to get full coverage and to blur out my imperfections. However, the coverage is lasting and it did say on all day through a day of work at the office."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,call me crazy,"February 27, 2020",540 Light,5,"Call me crazy, but this is hands down the best foundation that I have ever used. When I tell you it STAYS on my face... its there. I can wear it all day, sleep in it, and still have to wash it off and it comes off on my washcloth the next day. It doesn't dry out my face but rather leaves an even skin tone. I am not a big makeup person. I love eye makeup, but I just do the rest because I have to. I use a basic primer and then this on top and it looks great and last all day. I absolutely love it and I will be buying this and keep it!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Looks TOO light at first but good after blending,"December 13, 2019",520 Fair,4,"I decided to try this on my way out to an event. That was a bit dangerous! When I first started applying this, I was a bit horrified, because it looked SO light. I was worried I would look like a mime! I figured I'd have to remove and use another product. However, once I finished blending, it actually looked fine. I asked my critical husband and daughter and they both gave a thumbs up. The makeup was moisturizing and stayed on till I removed it. I would probably order a darker shade though."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,A Little Goes a Long Way,"January 12, 2020",600 Rich,4,"The product applied smoothly and stayed on for a reasonable period of time.It didn't highlight lines that you're trying not to highlight.It was fairly moisturizing.I (middle years female) usually use Clinique Even Better Glow;  this product is comparable and less expensive.The color wasn't exactly spot on as tested (this was a review sample), so be sure to color match before ordering.The best part:  A little goes a long way."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Fantastic product! Really light nice coverage,"August 8, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,5,"I'm not really a make up person specially with wearing masks now with covid but I tried this and I love it . It's so light it feels like you not wearing anything. Nice medium coverage I would say,melts in skin. In the first pic,I put the foundation on one side of my face. And you can clearly see the difference.then I put an individual photo of each side.then the last pic is a few hours later. I have oily skin so I was oily. But overall I would use this everyday."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice coverage,"December 28, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,4,"This is a good liquid foundation. The coverage is good and still feels lightweight. I don't find it very moisturizing, but to each his own since there are so many skin types and needs! For me a good moisturizer and then applying makeup is just how it has to be. The ingredients that are missing are key - and something we should all demand. Still some room to clean up the listing a bit, but for a major brand that can be found in any store, this is a great start. Overall I am very pleased."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Nice Coverage, but Not Long Lasting","September 19, 2020",,4,"This is a fairly decent concealer. It covers nicely, blends in well and is fairly thorough, so I’d consider it fairly okay overall. The main concern I have is that it doesn’t seem to last long. Definitely had it wear down much faster than most concealers than I’ve used in the past, so I’d recommend carrying it with you if you plan on a long day of wear. Other than that though, it’s certainly not bad!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Feels so Good,"June 22, 2020",600 Rich,4,"I was a little concerned that the tube of Covergirl ""Rich"" color was going to be a too dark foundation for my face but I am happy to report that the foundation went on smoothly and blended into the color of my skin leaving a dewy texture. It did not look overly heavy - more like the color of my own skin with a shine on it. There is no odor and is easy to remove with a removable wipe.  There are many other shades to choose from."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice look,"September 19, 2020",,5,"Clean Fresh Powder from Covergirl goes on smoothly and looks completely natural.  Doesn't look like you have any make up on whatsoever.  I don't have oily skin, so I don't use powder to absorb oil, but to give a nice finish to my make up.  The compact is cute and pink, and has a mirror inside.  Comes with a soft puff to apply.  I really like it.  Comes in all different shades to suit your skin color."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Excellent Coverage, Lightweight","December 8, 2019",560 Medium,5,The coverage of this is excellent.  It really hides the flaws without feeling heavy on your face. I also like that it doesn't settle in the creases.  I made sure I looked for that because that's something I have issues with.  It's more liquid that I expected.  I thought it would be a little more creamy.  It still goes on well and is soft on the skin.  I'm very happy with this and it exceeded my expectations.  I love that it has no smell and is not irritating to my extremely sensitive skin.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good stuff,"September 26, 2020",,4,"I ordered this by mistake and was afraid that this would look white on my skin. Turns out that wasn't the case at all. This takes away the shine without caking or leaving a white cast. I have very oily skin and one application lasted over 4 hours. I am quite impressed with this. Also, I love the handy, trademark CoverGirl compact. Still the best one out there."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great coverage!,"October 1, 2020",,5,"This concealer offers good coverage and the color matches my skin well. It has a wand that twist out easily  and, is easy to manuaver.  The makeup  blends nicely  and stays in place throughout  the day. I use this for my dark circles under my eyes, it definitely  makes me look less tired. This makeup caused my sensitive  skin no irritation  or discomfort and does what it's ment to do."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"No Harmful Ingredients, No Skin Irritation","February 8, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,4,"This Covergirl foundation blends in nicely on my skin, although it doesn't offer as much coverage as I prefer. The 590 color matched my skin tone well.  I found it a big plus that this product contains no harmful ingredients and has no nasty scent. My skin often breaks out when I use certain products, but this foundation doesn't irritate my skin at all. Very good product for the price."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very lightweight coverage. Liquidy,"December 10, 2019",580 Tan,3,"Great for younger folks or people with near perfect skin. The ingredients are what was appealing to me, knowing im not putting harsh chemicals on my face. It is moisturizing and doesn't dry out my skin. As far as coverage, it is lightweight so don't expect every blemish to be concealed or redness to be covered, it will help slightly though and give a subtle soft look. More liquid than I expected. I will use it for normal days though and more coverage when I go out."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nourishing makeup with an even finish,"December 2, 2019",530 Fair/Light,4,(Review by my wife) The makeup appears much darker in the bottle than what color the it went on. The formula is very smooth and feels very moisturizing. It definitely works to blur small lines or imperfections. It has a sheer coverage that can be layered. It definitely works better with a setting spray or primer. It could be blended with your hand or a blending sponge. The coverage is nice and even. The makeup is made with coconut milk and aloe extract.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Ok coverage,"December 12, 2019",550 Light/Medium,4,I haven’t purchased drug store makeup in quite some time as I almost exclusively purchase cosmetics at Sephora but I thought I’d give this a try.This formula was on the thinner side than I am used to. I use BB and CC creams in addition to traditional foundations and this one seemed very thin in comparison. I was however impressed that I was able to choose a perfect skin tone match.I think it wears ok but just a little too thin for me.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,VERY LIGHT COVERAGE,"January 20, 2020",530 Fair/Light,4,"This is very light coverage, more like a tinted moisturizer than a foundation.I'm very pale, and usually a product with a small  number of shades doesn't work for me. This is light enough for me.It gives my skin a little color and a smoother texture, but it doesn't cover redness . It doesn't provide all day coverage either. But it does feel good on the skin."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Light Coverage,"December 16, 2019",520 Fair,3,"COVERGIRL Clean Fresh Skin Milk, Fair, 520 FAIR has extremely light coverage. It goes on clean, but the coverage is practically non-existent. I have fair skin with red undertones, and this color made me look like a ghost, it is sooooo white. Awful. I have chosen a fair color in other products by Cover Girl and they were fine with warmer undertones, but this looks bluish, and just not attractive. Will have to pass on this one."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Nice little compact,"December 8, 2020",,4,"I have used covergirl products before but I don't normally use their pressed powder.  This has changed my mind. It provides a nice flat finish without looking cakey over foundation. For the price point I think the product is very good value for money, and is great to throw in my purse for touch ups on the go."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Great Concealer,"October 1, 2020",,5,I don't wear very much makeup but I do need to conceal the dark circles under my eyes.  I selected a color closest to my skin tone and I love this product. Not only does it conceal quite well but it does does go on smoothly and moisturizes the skin under my eyes. Really pleased with this product.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Light weight coverage, shade was too dark (needed porcelain, I guess)","December 24, 2019",540 Light,4,"I chose this in the light shade, hoping it would match my skin tones. Unfortunately it has too much brown/orange to work for me. I will purchase it in the porcelain which looks to be closer to my skin color. Shade aside, this feels great on. No build up or pilling. Covers my age spots well. Gives my skin a very smooth look. I really like it as a foundation and look forward to using it in a shade closer to mine."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very pleased,"January 18, 2021",,5,"Light coverage. I am using this primarily for my legs, small veins that break around my ankles. Also on age spots that are starting on my arms.... aka known as ""wisdom"" spots. The medium is a perfect match and isn't thick. It's a sheer coverage. Just enough. Thank you Cover Girl, and Amazon."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,works well,"December 27, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,4,"This product goes on feeling like a light lotion which is great in a dry winter. It blends easily. The color I ordered wasn't quite right for me so it looked like I spent too much time in the tanning booth, but does look very natural. The product was also easy to dispense. this is definitely something I would buy again but in a lighter shade."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I Need A Lighter Shade,"September 23, 2020",,3,I really like that it is more heathier than most concealers. I have the Light shade. It is very tricky for me to figure how much lighter I need to go.Porcelain is the lightest but I not sure if I need to go that far. When I apply and smooth in this. it looks faintly orange;.  Back to the drawing board.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Good coverage, lightweight concealer","October 9, 2020",,4,"This is a nice concealer, lightweight and providing good coverage.  The finish is nice, natural-looking and it aims to hydrate with coconut milk and aloe. (I use too little to be able to evaluate its hydrating properties). I do like that it has no formadehyde, parabens or sulfates. A good value."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Perfect for extra coverage,"January 17, 2021",,4,"I’m very happy with this concealer. I use it under my eyes and on blemishes for a little extra coverage. Looks nice and blends well on my skin. Sometimes I use it over my foundation, sometimes I use it without foundation. Works nicely either way. Color is what I expected."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Coverage is decent,"January 3, 2020",580 Tan,4,"It's really hard to choose foundation colors online. You pick a close shade and hope for the best. Initially the shade I got looked a little too dark for me, but once I blended it in, it actually blended in nicely and wasn't so dark.  It covers rather well, and I actually really like it. It's a pretty good alternative to the more pricey foundations I usually purchase."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Haven't been a fan of Covergirl till now,"June 28, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,5,This foundation has changed my opinion of Covergirl. I am very happy with the way it goes on as it is lightweight and provides a nice smooth look. I color tone is perfect for summer and really happy that it doesn't have any scent to it like past CG products I have tried. I will definitely re-order more
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Trusted brand foundation,"January 11, 2021",610 Rich/Deep,5,It has an intense color ( 610 rich/deep) so it is ideal for contouring if you have a bright color face. Considering the price it is much affordable than other similar foundations. It contains coconut milk which helps to hydrate the skin and aloe extract too.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good to Conceal Spots,"November 13, 2020",,5,"I use this as a spot/blemish concealer.  The little brush is perfect for that, and the concealer blends in perfectly without looking like you're wearing a concealer.  You only need a very tiny amount and this will last a long time.  I'm very happy with it."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,I Need lighter,"January 3, 2020",600 Rich,4,"I'm a fan of Covergirl product and have like them for years.  This foundation is too dark for me, it is a rich color, I'm a fair to ivory skin.  Do like that it is infused with hydrating coconut milk and aloe extract, and goes on feeling very light.  I will need to buy the fair-ivory color and see how well it is on."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Gives me medium to full coverage. Smooth, lightweight but costs too much for me.","December 29, 2019",580 Tan,4,"This Covergirl, Clean Fresh Skin Milk Tan surprisingly gives me medium to full coverage. I really like that it applies on smoothly. It's lightweight and a little amount goes a long way. I really don’t need to apply too much to obtain the coverage I need. Not bad, but the price is a little too high for my liking."
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Very lightweight.,"December 17, 2019",590 Tan/Rich,4,This tinted moisturizer is very nice and airy.  It goes on smooth and adds very minimal coverage.  It brightens my face nicely.  The scent is very mild and not really noticeable.  The texture is fluffy.  It didn't clog my pores or cause breakouts.  It kept my skin feeling soft even after removing.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Heavier than I expected,"June 8, 2020",590 Tan/Rich,3,"This was nice and moisturizing but it did stick to my skin and feel heavier than I had anticipated. Blends ok. Def not my favorite style, but I prefer lightweight minimal coverage and this is full coverage. I have oily skin, so that's why I avoid full coverage"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It's probably better for the younger generation,"December 9, 2019",540 Light,3,It does go on pretty smooth and covers well. I didn't notice any strong scent which I do like. It also does smooth out any discolorations on the face and looks pretty natural. What I didn't like is it doesn't feel good on my face. I think this would work for younger women with already good skin.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Works good,"September 21, 2020",,5,The pressed powder is a very good product. It matched my face well and blended in nicely. I used a brush to sweep it over my skin and eliminate a caked-on look. It does a decent job of controlling the shine and doesn't make me break out.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Good for the price,"October 29, 2020",,4,"Not bad at all - a very decent concealer for the price.  I've used it a few times now with a beauty blender and it blends nicely into my skin, isn't cakey, or too light.  The color is good for my skin and all in all I have no complaints!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Order one shade lighter than you think you need,"December 28, 2019",570 Medium/Tan,4,"I had a little trouble choosing the right shade, but I like the product.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,It's ok,"September 22, 2020",,3,"Basically it's just a tiny container of extra makeup to dab on to the miscolored areas on my face.

Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,Lightweight,"December 15, 2019",510 Porcelain,4,Nice lightweight coverage.  Doesn’t go cake’y.  The color is just what I’d expect it to be and matched my skin well.  A little goes a long way.  Easy to apply. Doesn’t irritate my dry sensitive skin.
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,"Lovely texture, just wrong color","September 25, 2020",,4,"This powder is very nice. It doesn't glob on or add too much fake color.

This was totally my fault, but it did make for a funny tan look on my face!"
Covergirl: Clean Fresh Skin Milk Foundation,So glad I tried this,"April 19, 2020",610 Rich/Deep,5,It has more orange tones than I hoped for but it makes my skin look great when I use just a little bit less than I normally would with any other liquid foundation.
